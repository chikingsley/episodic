MC is power-walking along the beachfront, practicing phrases under his breath.

**MC**:  
Bonjour, je m'appelle Mike. Tu es... non, vous Ãªtes trÃ¨s jolie. Comment tu t'app... Comment vous vous appelez ?

He stops, frustrated, and looks at his phone language app.

**MC**:  
Formal or informal? Which one?! Come on!

## Scene 2 â€“ The Beach Spot

**EXT. CANNES BEACH â€“ DAY**

MC is perched on a bench with his coffee, pretending to read but actually watching the cafÃ© across the street. Marianne (the golden duck from Episode 1) works there.

He gathers his courage, takes a deep breath, and crosses the street.

## Scene 3 â€“ The First Meeting

**INT. BEACHSIDE CAFÃ‰ â€“ CONTINUOUS**

MC enters, heart pounding. Marianne is wiping down the counter.

**MC**: (nervously)  
Bonjour.

**MARIANNE**: (looking up, friendly)  
Bonjour !

**MC**: (switching to practiced French)  
Je suis amÃ©ricain. Je m'appelle Mike.

**MARIANNE**: (smiling)  
EnchantÃ©e, Mike. Je m'appelle Marianne.

**MC**: (relieved she's responding)  
Tu es franÃ§aise ?

**MARIANNE**:  
Oui, je suis franÃ§aise. Tu parles bien franÃ§ais !

**MC**: (a bit sheepish)
Merci ! C'est mon travail... je suis professeur d'anglais.

**[FREEZE & TEACH]**  
ðŸŽ“ **EnchantÃ©e** â€“ "Nice to meet you" (Said by a female. Male would say `EnchantÃ©`. Silent 'e' at the end is pronounced slightly differently.)
ðŸŽ“ **Tu es franÃ§aise?** â€“ "Are you French?" (Informal `tu`. Adjective `franÃ§aise` is feminine to match Marianne.)
ðŸŽ“ **Tu parles bien franÃ§ais** â€“ "You speak French well" (Informal `tu`. `parles` is the `tu` form of `parler` - to speak.)
ðŸŽ“ **Je suis professeur dâ€™anglais** â€“ "I am an English teacher" (Spaced Repetition! Remember `Je suis` = "I am". Link: `professeurâ€¿d'anglais`)

## Scene 4 â€“ Getting Braver

MC orders a coffee. Their hands briefly touch when she hands him the cup.

**MC**: (gaining confidence)  
Tu viens d'oÃ¹, exactement?

**MARIANNE**:  
Je viens de Nice, mais j'habite Ã  Cannes depuis trois ans.

**MC**: (nodding like he understands completely)  
Ah, bien sÃ»r. Je viens des Ã‰tats-Unis. De... Florida.

**MARIANNE**: (in English, with accent)  
Florida! Mickey Mouse!

They both laugh.

**[FREEZE & TEACH]**  
ðŸŽ“ **Tu viens d'oÃ¹?** â€“ "Where do you come from?" (`viens` is `tu` form of `venir` - to come. `d'oÃ¹` = from where)
ðŸŽ“ **Je viens de** â€“ "I come from" (`viens` is `je` form of `venir`)
ðŸŽ“ **les Ã‰tats-Unis** â€“ "The United States" (Listen for the link: `Ã‰tatsâ€¿-Unis`. Final 's' in `Ã‰tats` is silent, 's' in `Unis` is pronounced /z/ because of the link.)
ðŸŽ“ **Bien sÃ»r** â€“ "Of course" (Silent 'r' at the end.)

## Scene 5 â€“ The Number

MC is about to leave, but turns back.

**MC**: (summoning courage)  
Je peux avoir ton numÃ©ro?

**MARIANNE**: (hesitates, then smiles)  
Oui. Je peux avoir ton tÃ©lÃ©phone?

MC hands her his phone. She types her number in.

**MARIANNE**:  
VoilÃ . Je travaille beaucoup cette semaine, mais...

**MC**: (not fully understanding)  
Ah... d'accord.

**MARIANNE**:  
Ã€ bientÃ´t, Mike!

**MC**: (grinning)  
Ã€ bientÃ´t, Marianne!

**[FREEZE & TEACH]**  
ðŸŽ“ **Je peux avoir** â€“ "Can I have" (`peux` is `je` form of `pouvoir` - can / to be able)
ðŸŽ“ **ton numÃ©ro** â€“ "your number" (`ton` is informal "your" used before masculine nouns)
ðŸŽ“ **ton tÃ©lÃ©phone** â€“ "your phone" (`ton` is informal "your" used before masculine nouns)
ðŸŽ“ **Ã€ bientÃ´t** â€“ "See you soon" (Common farewell)

## Scene 6 â€“ The Text Message

**INT. MC'S APARTMENT â€“ EVENING**

MC is pacing, composing a text. He speaks as he types.

**MC**:  
"Bonjour Marianne. C'est Mike. Le... duck amÃ©ricain."

He pauses, wanting to say more.

**MC**:  
"Je voudrais... te voir... demain?"

He hits send, then immediately panics.

**MC**:  
Wait, was that too forward? Is "voudrais" even the right word? Oh god.

His phone buzzes. A response!

**MARIANNE (TEXT)**:  
"Bonjour Mike! Je voudrais aussi te voir, mais pas demain. Je vais envoyer un message quand je suis libre. Bonne nuit!"

**MC**: (confused, checking translation app)  
"I would also like to see you, but not tomorrow. I will send a message when I am free. Good night!"

OK, so maybe tomorrow doesn't work, but she wants to see me again!

**[FREEZE & TEACH]**  
ðŸŽ“ **Je voudrais** â€“ "I would like" (Polite way to express desire, conditional tense of `vouloir` - to want)
ðŸŽ“ **te voir** â€“ "to see you" (informal `te`. `voir` = to see)
ðŸŽ“ **envoyer un message** â€“ "to send a message" (`envoyer` = to send. Link: `unâ€¿message`)

## Cliffhanger

**INT. MC'S APARTMENT â€“ LATER THAT NIGHT**

MC's phone buzzes again. He grabs it, expecting another message from Marianne.

Instead, it's a notification from a social app: "Marianne has posted a new photo."

MC opens it eagerly. It's Marianne at a beach bar, laughing... with a handsome male duck's arm around her shoulder.

**MC**: (to himself, shocked)  
C'est qui, lui?

**[FREEZE & TEACH]**  
ðŸŽ“ **C'est qui, lui?** â€“ "Who's that guy?" (Informal question. `lui` = him)

Fade to black.
