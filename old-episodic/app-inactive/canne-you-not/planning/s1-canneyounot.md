Refined Season Arc (Title: “Canne You Not”)

A 25-year-old American moves to France to teach English, only to be reassigned to sleepy-ass Cannes. Armed with baby French and big dreams, he meets a smoke-show duck who makes him forget all his plans. With love triangles, misunderstandings, parties, and therapy in the mix — he learns to speak… and feel.

 • Marianne – the fine-ass French duck (mysterious, flirty, multilingual)
 • Luc – hot French duck who’s known Marianne for years, probably rides a moped
 • Mme. Garnier – landlady duck, old, salty, breaks the fourth wall to explain grammar
 • (Jonathan) TheraDuck – your therapist duck in episode 9, extremely calm, wears glasses
