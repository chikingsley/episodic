The Pimsleur Method: Final Universal Template
Here is the finalized, comprehensive model of the Pimsleur Level I methodology, built and verified from our cross-linguistic analysis.

Part I: The Macro-Progression (The Conversational Journey)
This template outlines the sequence of conversational blocks. Each block may take 2-4 lessons to complete.

Phase I: Foundational Dialogue (Approx. Lessons 1-3)
Goal: Establish basic identity and the ability to initiate a simple conversation.

Block 1: Can We Communicate?

Topics: Politeness ([Excuse_Me]), Understanding ([Verb_Understand]), Language Names.
Grammar Introduced: Basic [Question_Formation] (e.g., particle, intonation), simple [Negation], [Pronouns_I/You].
Block 2: Basic Courtesies & Well-Being

Topics: Greetings ([Hello]), Well-being ([How_Are_You]), Polite Responses ([Fine_Thanks]).
Grammar Introduced: [Greeting_Verb_Conjugation] (e.g., aller, поживать), [Conjunction_And].
Block 3: Identity & Origin

Topics: Nationality & Origin ([American], [Came_From_X]).
Grammar Introduced: [Verb_To_Be] (am/is/are), [Grammar_Tool_For_Identity] (e.g., adjective agreement, gendered nouns, origin structures).
Phase II: Interacting with the Environment (Approx. Lessons 4-7)
Goal: Move beyond personal state to navigating the physical world and expressing needs.

Block 4: Locations & "Where" Questions

Topics: Simple locations ([Street], [Hotel], [Restaurant]), Directions ([Here], [Over_There]).
Grammar Introduced: [Question_Word_Where], [Grammar_Tool_For_Nouns] (e.g., articles le/la, cases в/на, particles は/が).
Block 5: Expressing Desires & Needs

Topics: Basic actions ([To_Eat], [To_Drink], [To_Buy]), Indefinite items ([Something]).
Grammar Introduced: [Verb_Form_For_Desire] (e.g., polite conditional would like, direct want, request please give me).
Block 6: Making Plans & Ordering

Topics: Time concepts ([When], [Now], [Later]), Meeting places ([At_My/Your_Place]), Ordering specific items ([Wine], [Beer]).
Grammar Introduced: [Question_Word_When], [Grammar_Tool_For_Unspecified_Quantities] (e.g., partitive articles du/de la, or simple nouns).
Phase III: Adding Specificity & Complexity (Approx. Lessons 8-10+)
Goal: Refine communication with details like numbers, time, and future intent.

Block 7: Numbers & Choices

Topics: Small numbers ([Two], [Three], etc.) for ordering.
Grammar Introduced: [Conjunction_Or], [Grammar_For_Number_Agreement] (e.g., cases after numerals).
Block 8: Telling Time

Topics: Asking for and stating the time.
Grammar Introduced: [Question_Word_What_Time], [Structure_For_Stating_Time] (It is X o'clock).
Block 9: Discussing Future Intent

Topics: Stating what one is "going to do."
Grammar Introduced: [Grammar_Tool_For_Near_Future_Tense] (e.g., helper verb aller or собираюсь + infinitive).
Part II: The Lesson Micro-Structure (The 30-Minute Workout)
This is the internal structure and pacing for every single lesson.

Phase 1: Spaced Repetition (Approx. 25-30% of lesson time)

The lesson begins with rapid-fire, narrator-prompted recall of core vocabulary and structures from the previous 1-3 lessons. No new material is introduced.
Phase 2: Introduction & Deconstruction (Approx. 20%)

A new vocabulary word or grammatical concept is introduced.
The narrator often provides a literal translation or analytical context (e.g., "In French, you say literally...").
The word is broken down into syllables, often using the backward buildup technique for pronunciation practice.
Phase 3: Integration & Active Recall (Approx. 30%)

The new concept is immediately combined with a recently reviewed, known concept.
The user is prompted to produce this new combination before hearing the correct answer (The Principle of Anticipation).
The correct answer is confirmed, providing immediate feedback.
Previously learned concepts are deliberately interleaved to strengthen memory.
Phase 4: Synthesis & Role-Play (Approx. 15%)

The narrator guides the user through short, controlled conversations combining all the new and reviewed concepts of the lesson.
Phase 5: Conclusion (Approx. 5%)

The lesson often ends by replaying the "hook" conversation from the very beginning.
The narrator states the "80% mastery" rule before ending the unit.
