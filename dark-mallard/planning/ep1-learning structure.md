COMMANDANT RENARD: "Agent Dark Mallard, welcome to Operation Riviera. Your mission begins with establishing a credible presence in Cannes. First contact is critical - one linguistic misstep could compromise the entire operation.

Your objective: Master essential greetings and basic conversation to maintain your cover. The local café scene provides optimal practice ground with minimal exposure risk.

Remember: You're not a tourist. You're a professional with a mission. Act accordingly."

Renard will be... let's say 'not entirely disappointed.' In this business, that's high praise.

Tomorrow we'll work on your background story. Study the dossier tonight - we can't afford any inconsistencies in your narrative.

The game is just beginning, Dark Mallard. Stay sharp."

Expanding Learning Structure & Narrative Elements
Assessment & Feedback System
Let's create a spy-themed feedback system that reinforces learning while maintaining immersion:
Cover Identity Integrity Report (Assessment)

Performance metrics displayed as "security ratings" with specific feedback
Areas to improve framed as "vulnerability alerts"
Success elements highlighted as "operational strengths"

Example Feedback Format:
MISSION DEBRIEF: OPERATION CAFÉ ENCOUNTER

COVER INTEGRITY: 87% MAINTAINED
- PRONUNCIATION: 75% (VULNERABILITY DETECTED)
- VOCABULARY DEPLOYMENT: 92% (OPERATIONAL STRENGTH)
- RESPONSE TIME: 85% (ACCEPTABLE)

CRITICAL INTEL: Your greeting protocol is solid, but your pronunciation of "Je voudrais" risks exposure. Review audio file #A-734 for correction.

FIELD RECOMMENDATION: Focus tactical training on nasal vowel sounds before next deployment.
Skill Tree Implementation
We should map out how skills build upon each other in a tactical framework:
Tactical Skills Network

Visualized as an intelligence network rather than traditional skill tree
Skills connected by operational relationships
Prerequisites framed as "security clearance requirements"

Core Skill Branches:

Infiltration (Speaking & Listening) - Social interaction skills
Intelligence (Reading & Comprehension) - Information processing
Communications (Writing & Grammar) - Message creation
Tradecraft (Cultural Knowledge) - Behavioral integration
