Here’s the playbook I’d hand a team of teachers/voice-talent so they can pump out new Pimsleur-style lessons without reinventing the wheel.

## 1. “Single-Lesson Skeleton” – the **non-negotiables**

Use this **exact scaffold** every time. It’s the secret sauce that makes recall spacing identical across courses.

| #  | Block                               | Timing      | What MUST happen                                                 |
| -- | ----------------------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0  | **Preview Dialogue**                | 0:00-0:30   | 2-3 native lines, no translation, cold open.                     |
| 1  | **Goal Teaser**                     | 0:30-1:00   | Narrator promise: *“You’ll understand & say this in 30 min.”*    |
| 2  | **Rapid Review**                    | 1:00-3:00   | 1-min drill on last lesson’s items, then park them.              |
| 3  | **Teach New Chunk A**               | 3:00-7:00   | Back-chain → full → cue-prompt.                                  |
| 4  | **Teach New Chunk B**               | 7:00-11:00  | Same pattern, then **combine A+B**.                              |
| 5  | **Teach New Chunk C**               | 11:00-15:00 | Same, combine with earlier.                                      |
| 6  | **Pronunciation/Grammar Spotlight** | 15:00-16:00 | 60-sec micro-note + focused drill.                               |
| 7  | **Teach New Chunk D**               | 16:00-20:00 | Introduce & integrate.                                           |
| 8  | **Recall Cycle 1**                  | 20:00-24:00 | Narrator English cues → learner responds with A-D.               |
| 9  | **Mini-Dialogue Build**             | 24:00-27:00 | Learner plays *one role* in a scripted scene.                    |
| 10 | **Full Replay + Echo**              | 27:00-29:00 | Original preview, this time with learner speaking missing lines. |
| 11 | **Wrap-Up**                         | 29:00-30:00 | Narrator recap of functions just mastered.                       |

> **Pause key**
> Small = 2 s · Medium = 4 s · Long = 6 s.
> Narrator never exceeds 20 words per instruction.

## 2. “Function Cookbook” – pick 4-6 new moves per lesson

| Lesson # | Core Communicative Functions                                                           | Cultural hook idea         |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| 1        | Get attention · Ask “Understand?” · Say nationality · “A little”                       | Key phoneme/tones          |
| 2        | Greet (time-of-day) · Ask/answer “How are you?” · Thanks · Goodbye                     | Formal titles / honorifics |
| 3        | Numbers 1-10 · Ask price · Order a drink · Say “too expensive”                         | Currency / tipping note    |
| 4        | Directions (left/right/straight) · Ask “Where is…?” · Landmarks · “I’d like to go to…” | Gestures vs. words         |
| 5        | Time (hours) · “What time is it?” · “When does X open/close?” · Setup appointment      | 12- vs 24-hour clock       |
| 6        | Family words (wife/husband) · “Do you have…?” · Possession pronouns                    | Addressing elders          |
| …        | …                                                                                      | …                          |

**Use the same four-chunk rhythm**: two **utility chunks** first, optional one-minute spotlight, two **situational chunks** second, then merge everything.

## 3. Author-friendly **Markdown template**

```markdown
# [Language • Level] — Lesson [##]

## META
New lexical items: 6-8
Pronunciation target: [rolled r / tone 3 dips / mora timing]

## 0 • Preview Dialogue
| Spkr | Native |
|------|--------|
| A | “[Line 1]” |
| B | “[Line 2]” |
| A | “[Line 3]” |

## 3 • Chunk A  — “[Excuse me]”
- Native model
- Back-chain bullets
- Prompt line(s)

## 4 • Chunk B  — “[Do you understand English?]”
…

## 6 • Pronunciation Spotlight
> Rising tone on [word]

## 8 • Recall Cycle
| Cue (English) | Learner expected |
|---------------|------------------|
| “Say ‘Good morning.’” | [Chunk B] |
…
```

Keep everything else (timings, pause lengths) **identical**. That guarantees true graduated-interval recall without you doing math.

## 4. Production checklist for teachers/studio

1. **Pre-script** the lesson in the template above.
2. **Highlight** every learner prompt in bold CAPS for the narrator; highlight every native line in a different color for the actors.
3. **Record** narrator first so actors can match duration of pauses.
4. **Master** with a -3 dB ceiling, normalize pauses to 2 s / 4 s / 6 s.
5. **Spot-check** that every new chunk appears at least **6 times** (3 isolated drills, 2 combos, 1 recall).
6. **Export** to 192 kbps MP3, mono.

---

## 5. When you reach Lessons 3-4+

* Stick to the **same skeleton**; only the cookbook functions change.
* Every fifth lesson, insert a **5-min consolidation dialogue** instead of new vocabulary.
* After Lesson 10, start a new “Season” but keep block timings so teachers can swap voices or themes without retraining listening habits.

### Bottom line

*Templates* give teachers a no-thinking-required scaffold.
The *cookbook* supplies interchangeable function sets.
Together they form a **toolkit** that reproduces the Pimsleur experience on demand—just plug in the target language and hit record.

### 3 · Chunk B — “[You speak (language)]”

### 4 · Pronunciation Spotlight — focus on “but” + adverb “well”

### 5 · Chunk C — “I am / Are you … ?” (gender or honorific variants)

### 5a · *Gender-swap micro-drill* (optional, 90 s)

### 6 · Chunk D — “I don’t speak very well” + polite contradiction line
