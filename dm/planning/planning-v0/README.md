# Planning v0 - Early Prototypes

Initial exploration phase with multiple technology stack experiments.

## Directory Structure

### üìÅ `prototypes/`

Early app prototypes exploring different frameworks

#### `prototypes/mockv1-expoapp/`

- First prototype using Expo/React Native
- Mobile-first approach
- Basic app structure and navigation

#### `prototypes/mockv2-nextjs/`

- Web-based prototype using Next.js
- Exploration of web technologies
- Testing different UI approaches

#### `prototypes/mockv3-bunapp/`

- Bun-based application prototype
- Performance-focused approach
- Modern runtime exploration

## Phase Summary

This was the initial exploration phase where different technology stacks were evaluated:

- **Mobile vs Web**: Testing platform approaches
- **Frameworks**: Expo, Next.js, and Bun
- **Architecture**: Basic app structure experiments

These prototypes laid the groundwork for choosing the final tech stack.
