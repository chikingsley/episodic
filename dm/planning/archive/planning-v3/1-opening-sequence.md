# OPERATION DARK MALLARD: REVISED OPENING SEQUENCE

## INTRO CUTSCENE: THE REASSIGNMENT

**[FADE IN: PRIVATE JET - 30,000 FEET - NIGHT]**
*Ambient engine noise. Luxurious but practical interior. A DUCK (player character) is stretched out on a bench seat, half-asleep. Across the cabin, SHELDON (a turtle) sits with headphones on, bobbing to music while reviewing files.*

*Sheldon's phone buzzes. He removes one headphone, answers.*

**SHELDON:** "Sheldon here. Secure line." *pause* "Yes, sir." *pause* "I understand." *pause* "Right away, sir."

*Sheldon hangs up, stares at his phone, then puts his head in his hands.*

**DRAKE (DUCK):** *(sitting up)* "What's up?"

**SHELDON:** *(gravely)* "They got Stella."

**DRAKE:** "What? Who got Stella?"

**SHELDON:** *(agitated)* "Paris. She's been dark for 36 hours. Last transmission came from the 4th arrondissement."

**DRAKE:** *(groaning)* "Paris? We're supposed to be wheels down in Barcelona in three hours! I've been cramming Spanish for weeks!"

**SHELDON:** *(interrupting)* "I know, I know! It's not my choice! This is coming from the top—Dark Mallard himself called me."

**DRAKE:** *(suddenly serious)* "Wait—Dark Mallard? The actual Dark Mallard called you personally?"

**SHELDON:** *(nodding grimly)* "Something big is happening. They're turning the plane around. We deploy to Paris in 6 hours."

**DRAKE:** *(sighs)* "Fine. At least your French is solid. You'll handle the talking, I'll handle the action."

*Long awkward pause as Sheldon adjusts his glasses nervously*

**SHELDON:** *(quietly)* "About that..."

**DRAKE:** "About what?"

**SHELDON:** "My French."

**DRAKE:** "What about your French?"

**SHELDON:** *(blurting out)* "I may have exaggerated my proficiency on my agency profile."

**DRAKE:** "Exaggerated how much?"

**SHELDON:** "Completely. I don't speak French. I cheated on my language qualifications."

**DRAKE:** *(incredulous)* "You WHAT?! How did you even—"

**SHELDON:** *(defensive)* "I needed the job, okay?! I'm good with tech, not tongues!"

**DRAKE:** *(pacing)* "We're about to drop into Paris, looking for a missing agent, with the syndicate crawling all over the city, and neither of us speaks French?!"

**SHELDON:** *(thinking, then brightening)* "Wait, wait—I have something."

*Sheldon digs into his bag, pulls out a sleek case containing high-tech contact lenses*

**SHELDON:** "R&D gave me these to test. Neural-linked contacts. They were designed for covert intel gathering, but..."

*He taps his tablet, bringing up technical specs*

**SHELDON:** "I can reprogram them. They'll connect to my optical nerve and cochlear implant. You'll see what I see, hear what I hear."

**DRAKE:** "So?"

**SHELDON:** "So, you'll be my handler! I'll be in the field, but you'll pick the responses. The contacts have a translation overlay. You select the right French phrase, I repeat it."

**DRAKE:** "That's your plan? Turn me into your puppetmaster?"

**SHELDON:** "Look, we've got 6 hours. The system has built-in training modules. You start learning now, then feed me lines when we land. After each successful interaction, the system will store the phrases. Soon, I'll start recognizing patterns."

**DRAKE:** *(skeptical)* "And if I pick wrong?"

**SHELDON:** *(grim)* "Cover blown. Mission compromised. Stella stays missing."

*Drake considers, then sighs*

**DRAKE:** "Fine. Give me the tablet."

*Sheldon hands over the tablet, grinning with relief*

**SHELDON:** "You're saving my shell here."

**DRAKE:** *(starting the first lesson)* "This better work. Bonjour, I guess."

**SHELDON:** "By the way, the program tracks your progress with something called 'Cover Integrity.' Keep it above 25% or we're toast."

*Drake looks at the tablet, sees "COVER INTEGRITY: 85%" displayed*

**DRAKE:** "Alright, let's do this. Operation Dark Mallard is a go."
