# Kata Consultation

You: Hello!

Kata: Hi. I'm Kata. I am a game designer and writer by trade, but I'm also a language nerd, so you really found the best person.

You: Wow. That's why I saw your profile and was like, what is this girl doing? This girl is... I can't imagine. I was just reading this stuff and was like, oh my goodness, this is probably... yeah. And then when you mentioned Chinese and the languages, I'm like, okay. I don't think... yeah, it's probably the best person to talk to about this stuff. Because I have so many ideas, but you have to make something. You have to make a first version and then a second, you know what I mean? You have to live your life. So I haven't talked to anybody else on it. Like I've talked to a couple of people technically, like maybe how to technically do it, what things to use. So I think I have a decent base on that. But as far as the story, I'm like, man, I've never done anything like this before. I'm completely talking... I'm like, you know, we're using AI, and AI is good, but I don't like AI for stuff like this.

Kata: No. And I would prefer to at least get a real person, especially somebody with experience. Especially somebody, it seems like you actually participate and you're into visual novels and you're a member of the community as well.
You: So it's like, I'm pretty new to it myself and I enjoy it. But obviously, like starting, being like three months into visual novels and then you're like, I'm going to make one. It's kind of insane.

Kata: Yeah, well, it's really fun though, because that's how you start. They are kind of like a gateway to creating other games as well. For example, I started out writing just for visual novels, I mean for stories and then visual novels, but now I'm working as a narrative designer for a platformer. So it's still a game, so it's much more simple, but it's still a huge task, especially when you're new to it. But I'm glad to report that I am absolutely on board with the idea. Yes. Wow. Yeah, it sounds really fun. Because what we have at the moment, and again, I'm saying this as someone who has dabbled in learning apps and stuff like that, and Visual Novels. A lot of the learning apps, and then textbooks, especially, I found are super boring. For example, there's the whole thing with Duolingo right now, focusing on AI. I haven't even checked that out. But all of the others obviously use some sort of AI as well. But I've been feeling a lot like they're really not delivering on the story front, which is a huge thing that you could still build into it. And obviously, they don't do it because it's so much easier to teach French when it's whatever.
You: That's what I was going to say, the path is already there. It's like literally this has been done, it's proven, the apps are there, and I think half of the industry is just copy-pasting the success of Duolingo and no one's... And then honestly, to create the story, to create something like this, it's a lot of work. You have to pick, of course, not only do you have to write the story, but then you also have to know... The way I wanted to do it with the Pimsleur, I don't know if you were able to listen to that audio style lesson a little bit?

Kata: I am familiar with it as well. I am a TEFL teacher. Well, I was a TEFL teacher. But I know drilling.

You: Oh, so you know way more of the industry. Because I loved that style of lesson. To me, of course, it's still boring, but I love the style of lesson because it gets you speaking from the first day. If you just listen to these things, you'll be speaking the language. And then if you listen for 30 days, you will just be speaking. Whereas to me, all other language learning apps, it's like you can play... There's even a couple of language learning games, like platformers. You could play these for days or weeks or years and unless you have something else, you won't have any progress in the language. So I'm like, is it possible to combine something that works with some level of gamification, some level of story? And that's the part where I'm... yeah.
Kata: I think this is very difficult. Sorry, so this is really difficult. Obviously, I got training on how drilling works and how immersive... I was a teacher for a while. And the thing is, the reason that works is because just like when it comes to tasting things, you have to taste something like eight times until you know if you like it or not. The same kind of thing is like, you actually have to hear things several times until it really registers in your brain. And obviously, with Duolingo and all of those other apps as well, they use that. But where I think their problem is, as someone again who has traveled and lived in several countries, is that you are still taking words out of context. For example, it's a little bit like the sentence you use quite a lot in the opening scene: "Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir?" So the thing is, kind of like that sentence as well, taking both out of context, you can learn it and you can know it, but you're still just learning repetition, and you're not getting context.

You: Yeah. I've heard that phrase so many times, but I've never known... I literally don't know what it means. I know what it means now, but everybody knows that phrase, but nobody actually in America, like people could say it. They don't know what it means though. Because it's been so divorced from...
Kata: Yeah, because if you think about it, the verb "se coucher" is just to go to bed or to go to sleep. So it's kind of like that's the exact thing as well. It's such contextual things because "je veux me coucher" means "I just want to go to bed." But then you hear that phrase and it's different. And I think those apps are really useful in drilling in grammar and just some sort of structure, but they don't really teach context. And what I think we could do with a slightly more immersive story is really teach context and understanding. But where this is difficult is that obviously when you have an actual story, some of that story is still going to have to be in English, and some of that story is going to have to be in French. And I think this is actually quite fascinating because you have to really find that balance where you're getting enough of a story each episode or part or level, whatever you want to call it, that people are still invested, but that they are actually still learning. Because if you are on level four and you're still learning "I want to drink some water" or whatever (pardon my grammar by the way, I speak fluently but I can't formulate sentences separately), so the kind of context is you really want to balance it. But I think your concept really might work.
One thing I wanted to touch on, and then we can kind of go over what other questions you have, is I looked through your opening scene, and I really quite like it. But I'm going to be the voice of reason here: way too much cursing. That is absolutely just a personal pet peeve and nitpick, but yeah.
You: Hit me. Oh, I don't even... Okay. Cool. So it's good to have some other human being around.

Kata: Because I curse, but when you overdo it, it just loses its effect, and I personally feel that kind of makes the whole scene lose a little bit. Otherwise, I think it's a really good opener because you actually give stakes. So it's not just like, "Oh, I'm an exchange student and I've come to Paris." So much that doesn't necessarily... I mean, it works, but it's been done so much in textbooks, and it's like you're reading the same exact thing. I don't have them right now, but I have a textbook in Chinese, a textbook in Korean, a textbook in French and Italian, and all four textbooks have the exact same storyline. Obviously not the same as an app in a book, but that's important to think about.

You: I saw it by the way, that's where I started. I was like, I literally have a guy goes to Paris, he likes a girl. It's literally what I started with. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, that's it. I was going to say that's an interesting concept because if...

Kata: And then I think what I'm just noticing now is that you have a question where it's like, "So what's your level of French?" Are you going to just go with the regular scale, like A1, A2? What exactly?

You: I don't have a plan necessarily. Like if somebody is... if you know yourself, what is ready, right? You're like, "I speak French and I want to play the game." Well, then the whole thing will change. So I was thinking, I don't... yeah, so that might not even be a question. It's more of just like, "Hey, you want to learn the language," kind of starting from wherever you get a good base, or you're starting basically from scratch, but it's like you want to just relearn it. This is what it's doing, and it's building on that. Because the future version could be super dynamic, and we're like, "Hey, our first mission now is you're just going in and having conversations with people from minute one," and it's accomplished vocabulary. But look, day one, I don't think I would have that. Maybe third version, but that's a good question.
Kata: No, it's definitely a good... I think because I was going to ask how you're going to differentiate because obviously, everything would basically change based on that, and that's kind of important to know. But I honestly think this is, other than the cursing which is just a personal thing, a lot of fun. The other thing is, I will say, I wouldn't use the song quote. As fun as it is, that's not even because of cursing, but because of copyright.
You: Which one is it, the song? Oh, that little quote thing. Okay, that was just a random, yeah.

Kata: From "Lady Marmalade," yeah. But that is just, you might be able to. Because that is the other thing I was thinking, is like technically you could do "omelette du fromage" from Dexter's Laboratory if you remember that whole meme where that's all he knows. But again, I would just look up to make sure that references like this are fine because sometimes they are, sometimes they're not. It's like quotes are fine, fair use and whatever, but I dabble a lot in anime-related things, and I always err on the side of caution with that. But I think the story itself is pretty tight, I would say. And I think what I find kind of fun in it is that you're giving stakes, but you're also kind of like, "Yeah, you messed up, so you really have to work for it." And I don't know, it just feels fresh but also still familiar enough with a crime or a mystery where it's like you really want to keep reading. I was like, "Okay, but what comes next now?" So that's quite nice. Did you have any questions you wanted to discuss when it comes to just the opening itself?

You: I guess I have some meta questions. Because to me, this is the part where I get a little stuck. I'm thinking if I do the audio lessons, for example, planning out the audio, that's a whole thing by itself. But planning out the audio lessons with the vocabulary context in mind and doing it in a way that it's not... My idea was kind of to have cutscenes or some things in the middle where I animate the characters or do something, so you have the story before. And then during the lessons, it's way more... maybe the visuals are way less, or the conversations, whatever it is, even if you're repeating after the person, it's probably going to be repeating to yourself a few times. And then it'll have like a moment where it'll have that. I'm just rambling. It's... I guess how would you, seeing as you have some experience on the game side and language and then even with visual novels, how would you approach something like this? And by the end, the last thing I'll say is, I was thinking of even having some choices, but I think that for me, it might be too complicated to start with some concept of choices, and it might just be something you're just like, "Alright, at least just build up the narrative forward-facing and start there." But I guess, yeah, how would you approach the thing? Is it as simple as, "Hey, I'm just going chapter by chapter, hitting each lesson?" How would you approach it?

Kata: I would do a couple of things. First of all, I would probably study a couple of actual courses, either in textbooks or something like that, and just look up, okay, so what is the basic vocabulary that you might learn in French? Like, a level A1 to B1 or whatever. I am technically a B1 level, but I lived in France, so it's a bit different in that sense. But I would kind of look up, okay, so this is going to be my scope. And once I have my scope, once I know this is the vocabulary set I'm going to teach, this is the grammar set I'm going to teach, these are all of the little things about French culture you might want to toss in. So why is it such a thing if you say "une baguette" and not "un baguette" or whatever? So once you've picked those things out, you can actually take, okay, in my story, I want A to be the beginning, Z to be the end. And I want this and this and this to happen. So which scenes coincide with which of these topics? And what can I do to make it still feel like a relatively normal conversation? I think again, this is going to be quite hard. But I think sort of going by theme and sort of adjusting that to your story might be a good idea. And I think you could plan your story first. Just like have an exact outline like you have a bit of right now. And I think that's pretty good. But you could plan the story first completely from line by line. Like, okay, so this is going to happen first, then that, that, that. And then adjust it. But my concern there is that what if you look at a textbook after and you're like, wait, none of what I have here is actually working with that. And it's kind of interesting as well that you're talking crime and stuff, right? You're talking like living in a hotel, whatever. That is awesome because of language learning. But that does make it a little bit more difficult as well when it comes to a course, I think. Obviously, you can still learn greetings and stuff like that. But I would maybe aim it to be a little bit of a higher level, or like starting anew. We have this in Hungarian, which is called "úJrakezdő," which means "start anew," but you already have a certain level. But I think what you could probably also do is talk to a French teacher and ask them, "Okay, so what are 10 things you as a speaker would want to, and the teacher would want to teach in a course like this?" For example, I hope I'm not rambling too much. But what is difficult is that that can work in the middle and the end. But in the beginning, when you're just teaching, I mean, you could with French, you could actually do a lot. Because, when you teach at an A1 level, whatever, you could actually teach formal versus informal, who you... You know, when it comes to formal, who do you talk to formally? What do you do? Whatever. But even then, I think it might be a little bit difficult to make the parallel for every lesson. However, this could absolutely work. And then obviously, for exercises, you have to add in more, you have to make a bigger, longer sentence, whatever. But I think that is probably for a bit later to figure out as well. And I think, again, there's definitely a niche market for this. And there's definitely people who would really want to play it. But you also, I think you might want to study your audience, your exact audience. Because what is kind of interesting in today's world, and especially with AI, which I'm not the biggest fan of (I'll use it for certain things like training my former feral cats, and it's so nice to log their progress somewhere, but I don't use it for generating things), people can really easily get information now. So that has also made people's attention span lower. And that means, for example, me as an autistic child when I was six or seven, you could sit me in front of a cassette that was an hour and a half, and I would listen to the English for who knows how long, filling in things. But you might not be able to do that, not even with kids now, but even with adults. So you really have to think about your pacing and making the game elements sort of addictive enough that people do come back for more. Because the thing with Duolingo and stuff, in its base essence, it is super simple. A couple of characters. Yeah, there are a couple of stories here and there. You know, it's not even about a story or anything like that. I mean, there is some sort of over-meta story, but it's not entirely. But the thing is, the reason why it works is because it really feeds the ADHD in people where it's just like, "Oh, a croissant. It's a croissant. Go on," and like, whatever. So you're just clicking through things. And that's also why it doesn't really work as efficiently. But I think what you could do is make the immersion enough to capture people. But that is difficult.

You: Of course. As in a... Sure. Yes. That's the issue. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Because it is, if you actually do it right, if there is a way to do it... Of course, the best language learning in the world is just fly to the country. Fly to the country, but not even... Fly to a city where they don't speak any English, like the countryside. Find a teacher there and live there for two months. You will learn the language. This is the best. Okay, but then every layer down from that, it's just harder and harder because you have to have that self-motivation. Like, "I'm in Paris, but I can't speak." As soon as they hear your accent, they switch to English. So you have to have that self-motivation. So yeah, that's why I was very interested in the problem. But yeah, there's a reason why everybody sticks with the easy thing. So I guess the next question would be, when would... So to bring in, for example, if I wanted to bring in another writer like yourself, what would you recommend? Hearing all this stuff, I'm like, okay. Now that I'm talking to somebody else and thinking about it, I'm truly like, I have some elements, but if I can't do the Pimsleur 30-minute thing... The Pimsleur 30-minute thing is from the 2010s; I don't know if it's completely irrelevant today. So the version of that that might work today would probably look a lot different. But I guess the other question is, if there was a dream, like if I did everything that you said, or you were like, "Okay, dream client who's bringing me this project." What am I bringing to you from that moment? Do I have mechanics lined up already? Do I have audience mechanics? And then like the animated characters for you to see? What is the different level of possibility to bring to you that would be like, "Man, okay, but this is amazing, got it." Because I know you've worked at many levels. You've probably worked with people that literally had almost no idea, maybe two things, I'm sure out of a thousand orders. And then I'm sure people, maybe even the studio or whoever hired you now, they probably have a lot of stuff ready for you to work on.

Kata: Thank you. And it really depends on how flexible you are. Because sometimes, yeah.

You: Oh, there you go. Hey, don't tell anybody. Yeah, sure. I'm more... I'm going to work hard. This is one of my fun things. It's challenging enough, technically challenging, and creatively challenging. And if you do it right, of course, a lot of people will be happy. It'll be a good thing in the world. If you do it wrong, if you do it bad, then it is what it is. But at least I'll learn a lot just in the process of doing this. So I'm not scared of work. I'm not scared of grinding.

Kata: I mean, it is amazing. Yeah. Of course. Yeah. So. Okay. So I think it's sort of like, if you're like, "Okay, here is my story. And I want all of these 10 things to happen. But other than that, you are free to do whatever you want." That is usually ideal for me.

You: Hmm. Okay.

Kata: And then you give me some base mechanics.

You: Sure.

Kata: You give me... Obviously, I can come up with ideas for mechanics, but I can't test them myself because I don't do programming and whatnot. But obviously, if you say, "Hey, I feel like we're missing some kind of puzzles. Can you come up with ideas for some puzzles?" Yes, absolutely. I love puzzle design, whatever. But I think as long as we're able to get on the same page on what level you're flexible on the story and what level I'm able to give, that's usually quite perfect. Because something that happens sometimes is that someone says, "Hey, I want a love story." And then it's like, "Oh, awesome. I can make 10 love stories if you want, whatever." But then it's like, "Oh, but actually, I wanted the male lead to be called Robert." So basically, when... wait, wait, wait.

You: Thank you. Yeah. So they come in after the fact with these different things and you're like, okay.

Kata: So basically, what you are absolutely set on having, things that are non-negotiable for you, give that all to me. Give me, the scope is, I don't know, for something like this, that's quite a big scope, and it's quite a big project, but we can break it down, whatever. But you give me, "Okay, we're going to do 10,000 words first. But let's do five of that first," and whatever. So give me a quote, give me a budget, a scope. Perfect. Tell me, "You are free to change anything," or "Please don't change these because I'm very happy with this." Absolutely fine. As long as you provide me with the necessary details. And just, something that also happens is like, "Send me lots of updates," or "Don't send me lots of updates." Because some people just, they're like, "Just send me the finished thing." And that's perfectly fine as well. But I need to know. But that's kind of it. For me, I've created a lot of things from scratch. I've also done a lot of things that I had, like a longer document than the writing I ended up doing to look through. So for me, that doesn't really matter as long as we're able to get on the same page. And if we need to talk like this for that, if we need to do a lot of brainstorming, chatting, whatever, that's perfectly fine. As long as we're on the same wavelength. But obviously, that is my personal flow. That is the way my brain works. So it's going to vary between different creators. But I, of course, I think most writers love it when they just say, "Go crazy."

You: Sorry. Okay. Do your best. Yeah, it's interesting. I think in the future, because I was working with... I do some of the animation, like 50-50, but I have a girl as well, and she did a great job. Honestly, my favorite people to work with... I used to be an engineer and project manager, and I still am to an extent, but I love when, just in my experience in my career, working with other professionals. And I'm like, "Hey, I need this done," and then they go off somewhere and they come back and it's done, and it's done well. This is like my whole career, I'm used to this. Now on the internet, the quality can vary, but at least for this project so far, I've been lucky with this girl that I've been working with on the animation side. So I think for the story, I'd probably lean more towards that. And I think that would be interesting. So the story is one level. Would you feel comfortable actually, if I had audio lessons, if I had a more defined thing for the audio lessons and said, "Listen, these are... hey, I have words, unit by unit, chapter by chapter, I have all of these words for however many, and then I have obviously these are the characters, and the lessons are going to be this kind of length, and this is the general possible format." Would that be something you're comfortable with, or is that more like you'd prefer the narrative parts, and then programmatically, or not programmatically, but like somebody technical, a French teacher, writes the mini lessons for speaking?

Kata: That will be important. It's just like, as long as I have that sort of worksheet of, "Okay, so these are all the things to put in here," I should be able to make it since I know how to lesson plan and I speak the language. But I'm kind of thinking right now, is it easier to do narrative first and then do this? Is it easier to make up the stories that's like, I don't know, a hundred words per lesson first, and then literally just take these words and fill it in? Or is it easier to just do everything but then go lesson by lesson? I probably would try both ways out just to see how it is. But I think we could probably just, once we have a storyline sort of figured out, we could just go for it. And of course, it's a big project, but we can sort that out, I think.
You: Sure. Hmm. Yeah, just leaving, like for individual listen, yeah. Yeah, that's what I was... yeah. Okay. And then I guess as a random, since we have some extra time for this, just on the spot. For one of the things I was trying to, I was playing around with games. I love in games when they have everything almost in the world. So it's like, if you have a power meter in a video game, you could have it like a big bar at the top of the screen, or you could put a little element on the character that's like the amount of water you have in your bag or something, and it correlates. I guess as one of the things that I was interested in trying to do was, I don't know, even the games, like if I had the Duolingo style little thingies, coming up with ideas for how to have that style of thing but in the world. Like some task or tasks where it's... There are some obvious ones for a spy thing, it's like, "Hey, these transmissions came in, translate." Okay, that's pretty on the nose, pretty obvious, translating stuff. But yeah, I don't know if you had any on the spot, like in this thing, what little minigames or little things in the middle between missions? I wanted to have ways to engage further if you wanted to do a Duolingo thing and wanted to mess around. And even a reason why you would do those things further than... Because I was also thinking, I wanted to have this lesson or this unit where you're doing stuff, and whatever the mechanic is, or you're training. And I guess you saw a little bit where I kind of was setting up a mechanic where theoretically, another character is going out into the world, and they don't speak French very well, but you have access to some stuff, so you can say stuff to them, and they can execute it in the world. And that was one level of a mechanic to play with. And then another level was, I don't know what it is specifically, but for some reason, you actually have to go out and have the conversation at the very end to finish that thing, like Duolingo has the ending thing. It's like, to finish it, you have to be the one to actually go out and do the thing. So I guess connecting the stuff together.
Kata: Hmm? Hmm? Thank you.

You: I guess having any ideas for like those little, maybe little games in the middle to prepare or anything where it's like, yeah, if you have any.
Kata: So what's the first thing that kind of came to my mind is that this kind of reads like a point-and-click or escape room to me.

You: Yes, it's way more, yeah. Ooh.

Kata: Uh, and obviously I'm going to say that is scope creep and it's going to cost a lot.

You: Ooh. Thank you.

Kata: I mean, it depends on what you consider a lot, obviously, but also it depends on what level you do that on. But I think there's a couple of ways to go around this. And one way would be to simply have some sort of a map. And on that map, you can actually go to different places and acquire different knowledge. And this knowledge might not be necessary. This might be just like, you know, learn how French people communicate. For example, is it called Verlan or Lambert? I think it's called Verlan, which is like flipped words. So for example, "fou," which is just like crazy, would be also like "ouf," or something like that. And then obviously there's some crazy ones. And I think, for example, those are like optional content, but it could still be very useful. Like, both for you as the player who might be just curious because you want to go to France or you want to see the story or something. But for obviously the character as well, because, oh actually, there is like a little test. And to some extent, it's very obvious because it's "fou" and then it's "ouf." So you can guess it, but you can also learn more about it and understand it better. And that would be the easier way, I think, where it's just like, you have a little map. You can choose where you want to go and there's this optional content, whatever. And I think you could do that with just some extra pictures and extra animation, whatever. It wouldn't be too costly. But then the exercise missions, you could also make into proper minigames. You could make them into puzzles. You can make them into anything from crosswords to word searches, you know, everything that is actually kind of fun. And you can justify that in the plot because it's like, "Oh, I don't know, the transmitter got all jumbled, and I have to figure out what is this word? What is that word?" Every once in a while, you're going to have a technical glitch when you're relying on such specific and high-quality technology; it's going to glitch out. And I think using those kind of glitches and using those kind of things on top of that as well could make it a little bit more justifying. So it actually, the first thing that came to my mind was more, I actually made a mistake there, because I meant more like a find-the-objects kind of situation. Like when you just look for the eggs and it's like, "Oh, she said they..." okay, that may be kind of not in the context, but like, "look for the poison." And it's just all the instructions in French or something like that. And I think that is actually an easier thing to implement. But then also you do have the kind of point-and-click element possible as well. But if you were referring to there, you can actually move around in the overworld to some extent, or just, for example, the first world or the first set of levels that is in the hotel. So, you have a picture of the hotel drawn or an illustration, whatever. And then you can go to your room first, and you click on your room, you go there, the lessons pop up, whatever. And then when you get out, you get back on the map and it's like, okay, so now I can go to the pool. I can go to the kitchen. I can go to whatever. And I think the reason why I like that concept a bit more than just what Duolingo and all of those do is that that sets you apart a little bit. Because right now, all of those apps... it's actually funny because I was just looking at one to practice a bit of Japanese because I don't speak the language, but I wanted to get a little bit of a tourism kickstart since we're going. And I was like, I got this app, but it looks exactly like Duolingo. And you go to some of the other big ones like Babbel and Memrise, and all of those are pretty much the same. So I think when you make it a little bit more like a map, a little bit more like an actual game, whatever, that could really just be on your side, help you. Even if you do a Kickstarter or if you do an ad campaign or whatever, even if you just advertise on itch.io or Steam or whatever. I'm guessing it's a mobile game. So it's a bit different. But still, that can help you set you apart from the thousands of other apps that already exist.

You: Thank you. Yeah. Yep. Thank you.

Kata: Because it's quite crazy. Yeah. I know, totally fine. No, it's funny because I'm in Sweden, and I actually don't speak yet.
You: Thank you.

Kata: So, let's staff it up. It is very cute.

You: Thank you. I don't know.

Kata: Yeah, I think the first thing that comes to my mind is that especially the doc does look a little Looney Tunes, but that is absolutely just because of the color and the hair and whatever. So probably just because of that. But obviously, this also has happened in several other franchises, so you can probably be totally fine with it. But other than that, I like that it's kind of grungy because again, in these apps, usually you have those very smooth... like you have the freaking Duolingo owl. He is who he's supposed to be, this whatever it is. But it's like on TikTok you see it being this menacing creature, but then in reality on the app, it's this cutesy whatever. And I think a lot of these apps kind of go with that as well. Like the Japanese thing I downloaded had this cute little Shiba Inu, and that's very cute, whatever, but that is every single app. So I like the grunge. I like that there's actually a set of gestures that he has. I like the, for the animation and whatnot, it makes it feel a little bit more dynamic already. And I think you could absolutely get away with something like this. I think it's just looking a little bit more unique to start with. Oh, that's fun. Yeah, that's fun. I love the ear flicks, that's adorable. I love it. I really like again the grunginess to it. It looks very sort of different from what you would expect in an app like this. And I think that again goes with what we might want to achieve. And I think what's kind of interesting as well is like you have these kind of rough-looking characters, so that also gives us a little bit more freedom when it comes to the language we're teaching. Obviously again, not so much cursing just because of ratings and whatever, but even then, we might be able to sort of hone down on more conversational French.

You: Now, I'm still... I'm going to do this. I'm going to be happy at... Thank you. Give me some, you know.

Kata: I think what's kind of interesting here as well is that you're really touching on that subject because those textbooks do prepare you for that and that only. So, my first English teacher, she actually used the method quite a lot that you referred to. And as a student, it was really boring, but it did work with drilling and stuff. But my first teacher, she was just completely by the book, nothing else. Granted, I was like four or five years old, whatever. So with children, that's something a bit different. But then, by the time I was taking private lessons and I actually was invested in language learning, I got to the point where I spoke as good English as the teacher did. It was really weird because at some point, I did really poorly in English because we had the book, and the book was sacred. But then my English was far higher than it. And I think, far better. But then obviously the teacher has to grade you based on that. So, if you have an app that really focuses on nuances and how it really is spoken, how French actually acts like a language, and facts about French, whatever, I think that can really, really work and make it unique. But then you can't start it from A1 or zero level. Because you can teach, "oui" is actually like, you say "ouais." But people won't really understand because they don't have the context of having sat through lessons and lessons and lessons of "oui, je veux cette normale" or whatever. I roll my R's really poorly in French now. But what I'm saying is, you have to choose what you go with. And you have to choose, okay, I'm going to start beginners. Because that's going to be your biggest market. That's going to set apart, instead of a thousand people who might be interested when you first launch, it might be 10,000 who might get the app. Now, again, from the 10,000, you might only retain 500. And from the thousand, you might retain 700, whatever. But you're really choosing your market and deciding, okay, I want to go with this. Either conversational French, but then higher level, or just teach it from scratch. That's going to be one core decision.

You: Okay, okay, like that. Okay. And then as a... hmm. The other thing I was kind of thinking about cheating on, or I don't know if I... I was wondering, if you... I can obviously, once you have one character, you can make, right? I can make 12 of these wolf characters with different hats and pants and stuff. I guess as far as... yeah, I guess one of the levels that I was trying to scope down was, also money-wise, it's probably, to get everything done for a character, even with me doing a bunch of stuff myself, probably like $200 to $250 per character. And that's basic stuff, that's not even assuming... Because I think even using the software, I'll probably have the people, maybe they're building out cutscenes in the same software even though it's not meant for that. So that's not even talking about that. But I guess, and then maybe the scope is just money. But for characters, as far as deciding, if you planned out a story, how do you think about that? Do you let the characters appear on their own in a way, or is it just, you have a... I guess it depends on the situation, but it's maybe too big of a question.

Kata: I think you could have a... I'll kind of say what I think right now. It's the same with visual novels as well. You can have a core cast who appears. And when they appear, they emote, they do their little motions and whatever. But you can limit your core cast to, I don't know, we have seven baddies, and we have the two main guys. We have like five people who... You know, you can limit it to 10, 15, whatever people, at least for the first big part of the game. And then you can have a side cast. It's like side people who are still important to the sense that they might be the ones you're talking to. They might be a waiter in the restaurant or whatever. But again, you don't necessarily have to show their face all the time. You don't have to have every single character. Because I think that also just gets a little bit too confusing for players as well. Imagine that, for example, a lot of the first set of lessons is in the hotel. So if every single hotel personnel has a different face, a different name, a different kind of animal that they are, whatever. First of all, you are spending a lot of money. But also, the main thing is, you are focusing too much, and the players are focusing too much on who I'm talking to as well. When in reality, what matters is the lesson itself. So I think I would probably choose a core cast. And then everyone else is just, they might appear in a background picture, or they might have a name, but they appear off-screen. And they're just faceless voids. But that's partially for simplicity and for scoping it down a little bit.

You: Yeah, it's just um... Okay, that's helpful. Okay, so we have a couple of minutes. Yeah, let's see. That's a... So you mentioned like 10 to 15. And I have not... I don't know, I have no clue. Like in a game or in a movie, I mean, what is... How big are... I literally have never thought about it. I usually just watch the movie. But there's stuff, obviously Game of Thrones where there's literally, I don't know, a hundred characters. There's so many. It might only be 50, but my brain just shuts down. But we figured it out at the end, and it's so good. The writers are so good, it doesn't matter. But I guess what's a... There's no such thing as a typical story. Obviously, it can range from two to whatever. In something in this genre, in a game type of thing, maybe you're playing as one or two people. Obviously, it's a big range. But where would you aim as far as people that are like, "Hey, these are..." At least a start. I mean, of course, you could do anything in the world. Let's say unlimited. Where would you start if you're like, "Hey, I can do anything I want." Like we're doing 15, 10, 6.

Kata: Yeah. I mean, again, it kind of depends on the story itself. Because in your story, you have your two main characters. And then you have a bunch of people who oppose them and whatever. And some of them are like the goonies who you can just not really give a big face to or whatever. But then some of them are, for example, the main boss, you have to make appear and whatnot. So what I would do is kind of like, either I could do it (obviously, not when I'm in Japan, perhaps, but after or something), I could write you a list of these are all the people that I think could be useful. But also, you could just sit down and like, "Oh, I think all of these people are useful." I would say, 15 at max. But also, just because we don't want too many people. But then, just write down the list of, "Oh, I think these people would be cool to appear." And then look at it like, "Oh, but actually, is that person necessary? What is their role? What do they do?" Because I have written visual novels with one character. And I have written visual novels with an extensive side cast, who didn't even appear, because if they had appeared, that would have been just impossible. So, I would say upwards of 15 sprites or something could be a good start. But you could probably narrow it down to seven, eight, and then adding people as you go. Or, "Oh, this person for some reason was really liked by the players. Let's give her a face now." Whatever. But again, this is so... it really, really depends on what you end up doing.

You: Sure. Yeah. Okay. That's too big of a... No, no, of course. But it's still, even that's good. Like I said, just to hear stuff. Even if I kind of have that, even if I have the idea kind of, just to hear it from somebody who does it, it's like, alright, it's good. Okay. I know we're close to out of time. I guess I'll ask just one more thing. As a... maybe you answered kind of already. As a person, you are a part of the visual novel community, and you write it, obviously participate in it. This is probably kind of the opposite community to Duolingo in my head. Probably because you're sitting down, you're reading something. Is there an element of visual novels that has changed or that is... that does appeal to more of a faster-paced person? Or is it all, or do they all kind of sit in like, "Hey, you're reading this thing, and we're assuming you're going to read this thing, and you're going to sit and read this, and that is what it is." And if that's the case, then yeah.

Kata: Yes. Yeah. This is a, yeah, it's a toughie. Because I still write visual novels, but I'm not an active part of the community at the moment. But I am relatively active when it comes to games. And when it comes to games, you still have a lot of games that have extensive story. And a lot of it. And obviously, you can't really compare, say, we played with my fiance, we played Blueprints. And you can't compare Blueprints to Duolingo. Not at all. But what games in general have is that catchy game loop. And that is the same as in Duolingo, which is just like, "Oh, click, correct, green. Yes, go on. Click, correct, green. Yes, go on." Now for games, for a roguelike, which is like Blueprints, then that's drawing a room that you really like. Maybe I am talking something you have no idea about. But so roguelike games are games where...
You: Okay. This is like the 2D... Okay, yeah. I've seen that because I'm on Game Dev YouTube. But I've never played one. But I see them all the time. Just in passing.

Kata: Yeah. So it's kind of like, with roguelikes especially, you have that element of, it always changes. And you have to go on. And even if you die, you retain some of your strengths, or you have to retry. But you have more knowledge of what's going on or something like that. And that, I think, kind of really works in this context, where it's like, for example, if you fail a lesson, you still have learned some of those words. But you're going to have to retry it. And you're going to have to push for it again. And it's kind of like, as long as you have a reward big enough when it comes to reading, when it comes to just going on, I think that's quite useful. And obviously, again, as you said, there's not a huge overlap between visual novel and Duolingo. But there is still a little bit in the sort of satisfaction of getting the right choice. And pushing on and figuring things out. And I think that's what you need to grab. Really, really grab that feeling of success. Or like the dopamine hit, basically. Because if you do, people will be willing to read a couple hundred words to get to the next lesson. And then obviously, people also like to look at animations and whatever. So that might also be useful.

You: So good. I just asked GPT to generate an illustration of my team. I generated like with some black people. And I was like, yeah, but I need to do black people. And it was like, no, I'm not going to do it. I was like, yeah, but my team, they're white. It's not about everything. Oh my God. I need to know. I need to do that. They catch me catching because Duolingo. I mean, there were apps before, but I don't know something about the little sounds and the little fire thing at the very end and the little... it's subtle little stuff. But it's like, they found fire. They found something. And then obviously there's actual games. There's just an actual game where you're fighting and stuff. And I've seen people try to make language learning games, and I don't think it's come through yet. So I'm comfortable.

Kata: We are finding that. There's a few, but I haven't really been able to play them much. The closest they have gotten was Chants of Sennaar. But then the game, the language was fictional. So it's phenomenal. It's amazing.
You: Wait, what is it? Which one is this? What is it called? How do you spell Sennaar?

Kata: But it's not a real language. It's Chants of Sennaar. I can send it to you. I will send it to you on Fiber, sorry.

You: I don't even use the Dalasri yet. Okay. Cool. Look at that. Okay. Chants of Sennaar. This looks cool. And the art is amazing. Yeah. And obviously it looks... and the streets say I think it's amazing too. It's got crazy good reviews. 20,000. That's crazy. Okay. I'll research. I'll look into. It's interesting because it's also like pushing.

Kata: It is a puzzle game. And it's really, really good. Says the language nerd. Yeah.

You: I've gamed very lightly, but I've only... I'm only familiar, you know, I'm familiar with like even just going through this thing. I've learned so many about so many things. I just never heard of like so much of the gaming industry. You know, I'm like a mainstream gamer, Call of Duty, the big dude, you know, I know this big stuff. And then I'm like, whoa, there's so many genres of stuff that... the whole world is gaming and I didn't even know about half the stuff existed. Okay. Wow. Thank you so much. Truly been very helpful.
Kata: Thank you as well.

You: Uh, just to know your general schedule. You said that you're about to go to Japan. So you're going to be enjoying your life, chilling for a little while.
Kata: Yeah. It's a week or so. We'll be back on the... I mean, so we'll be there for a week, but travel takes an extra couple of days. So I'll be back at the end of the month. But I will be available. You can shoot me a message kind of whenever. I will just take a while to respond because that's, you know. But before that, I will get a really quick summary of the meeting done. It's just a deliverable for these, like just a quick little summary. But yeah, again, whenever you write to me, I am super on board with this if we are able to figure out a way to work together.

You: So. Okay. You don't have food. Okay. Cause I, the biggest thing, I think, I'm also using this project as a way to start delegating stuff to other human beings that I trust and just like, alright, I literally need to stop doing everything. I'm done doing everything. We're just like, alright, you're just, I have these couple of things. Go do the story, girl. You do the story. Hey, you got this thing. You do the animation. I'm doing coding. And then, you know, maybe somebody else is helping out with that. So like, I'm just probably going to be starting to figure that out.

Kata: Yeah. But this, the game is your baby, of course you want to care for it. That's such a... I totally get it. Again, I am very possessive of what I create despite being a freelancer, so I totally get it. But I think you're on a really good way with it as well. And I'm speaking as the player now and not the writer, but if I wasn't potentially the one writing some of this, I would be the first one to get this. So it is just really a great concept, and I'm super excited to see where it goes. But it's hard to delegate because you want to do everything yourself, and then you crash and burn. Don't do that, please. It's not fun.

You: Hmm. Yeah. Exactly. So I'm choosing. I'm like, I do. I try to learn enough about, like I said, I wrote the first scene. I try to get something under my belt just so I understand, so I can have an opinion. Because I think, I don't want to be like one of those people that sends you the thing and says, "Okay, go crazy." And then you send back something, I'm like, "Oh, no." I didn't know how to communicate. So I at least get some basis so I know how to communicate what I want and then go forward. So have fun on your trip.
Kata: Yeah. I mean yes, thank you. Oh no, the only thing I wanted to say is to be fair, in a creative process, revisions are also completely normal. It's just like understanding that that's normal and knowing what the accent is. But I think we probably have a similar mindset when it comes to creativity, so I think we will mesh quite well.

You: Yeah, go ahead. Sorry. I think we'll probably, it'll probably be done in pieces, I think. Because that girl, she did this. Now I think I would send her all the characters and say, "Oh, crazy." But it's like, I think that pieces where it's like, okay, just check. Just to get a little check and just, especially for writing, it'd probably be like multiple scenes. But it's like this, okay, cool. Oh, I like this. Let's go in that direction, or I was thinking something different. But I think, yeah, I like your vibe. I think you, you know, you're like the... I mean, like I said, when I saw your face on the thing and read this thing and I saw your video. The video is the thing that I was like, okay.

Kata: Yep. Yeah. Yeah, I totally get that. Really, like the on the profile or the ones with the escape room stuff?

You: Yeah, man. No, on your profile when you were talking. I saw you talking, and then I was like watching you talk. And I was seeing the, I saw the description, and I was like, okay. And then I saw you talking and I was like, okay, this is my person. Probably 90% is my person. But let me hop on a call just to catch a vibe. But I was like, yeah, it's probably my person.

Kata: Okay. Okay, yeah. That's awesome to hear. No, because I felt so awkward with this video, but I think it does kind of convey that I'm a big nerd.

You: So. Well, it's like, dude, this, I was like, this person does. I was like, when I saw the video, I was like, this person is, this person lives in this, is, lives in this world. When you talked and obviously you have, you have a gamer look as well. I was like, this is my person right here. I don't want, certain people, I'm like, okay. I don't know if you, certain people, I'm like, you're just using chat GPT on this, man. I don't trust you. But you have a look.

Kata: They are. Be careful. Seriously. I will not go into length with that because you must not, but it's awful, and I have had problems getting art before AI was even big anyway. That is as much as I will say because it's still... But thank you so much. I am super on board with this, and I will get you that little quick summary, I think after I feed the cats. Because I'm really just getting ready for tomorrow.

You: Yes. And you, you said you're in Sweden or you're in Hungary?

Kata: Yes, I'm in Sweden.

You: You're in Sweden. Okay. I'm going to Sweden. I've been to Hungary. I've been hungry at the end. I'll be in Hungary in September. But I've never been to Sweden. Are you like in the main, are you in... yeah.

Kata: Cool. Did you like Hungary? Okay.

You: I mean, I've only been to Budapest. I don't know if I've been to Hungary. I've been to Budapest, right? It's like, you go to the main city. I can't say I've been to the main thing.

Kata: I'm in Stockholm.

You: Do you live in like the, a main place or are you in the, like, a side? Okay.

Kata: I'm not up north, that's why it's so easy for us to fly as well. Otherwise, it would be very a lot more complicated, I think, if we lived way much higher. But it's quite chill, finally good weather, so it's been quite nice.

You: Is it expensive in Stockholm? Yeah. Is it, is it a walkable city? Is it?

Kata: Yeah, oh yeah. Oh yeah, it is. Like we have nature just outside our door, and going to center and everything, you have to take like a metro or something, but then it's just like the whole center you can just walk through. It's very lovely.

You: It's amazing. Maybe I'll, I'll be going around. I'm going to Europe this summer. So I'll be around. Because I need, the one thing I haven't done in a long time, I haven't like actually traveled on purpose. I've just been going places where I'm needed. So I'm in Thailand right now because I'm working with some people, but it's like, I'm just needed here. It's nice to be here, but I don't... I'm like, when's the last time I actually traveled somewhere? Like, let me go to a place because I need to go. I want to go there. There's no other reason.

Kata: Oh awesome. Hmm. Yeah. No, I get that. But travel is nice. It's nice to have purpose, but it's also nice to just go and be there for like two weeks or however long you're able.

You: So go on, Connor. Yeah. I need, I need to add that element back into life a little bit, and we will. So, hey, and you know, maybe, I don't know where, how far are you from like Lithuania? Like the flight, like from Estonia? Is it like a hop?

Kata: You know what? I think it's like an hour flight or something, but I wouldn't know because it's actually kind of weird, but ever since I moved to Sweden, the only place I've been to is Oslo, and then I've been to Hungary, I've been to Bali, I've been like, I'm going to Japan, I'm going to Spain. I have not... I'm going to Denmark tomorrow for a layover, you know, that's something.

You: Okay. You've been to big, you have all these countries over here, like right neighbors and you're like, well, you know, okay, that counts as something that kind of will count it. I'll be fair. No. I was going to say, because I was talking to my friend, it's like in America, people talking to a girl who lives in California. You know, she's not been to anywhere in the States, but she's been to like 50 countries, but she's not seen, she's not been to the East coast. And I'm like, that is insane, girl. But to be fair, it's like speaking English and similar.

Kata: It's just how it is. Like once you've seen it, it is. I've been to DC and I've been to Portland, Oregon. It was quite different, I would say. You know, still the same country, but yeah.

You: Okay. That's, you saw. I would say, you couldn't have been to more, like Portland is a place. And I would say that is, people are so comfortable. As any place I've ever been in my life, they are the most comfortable being themselves, whatever that means in Portland. I've seen people dressed and doing anything, any identity. Whereas DC is like, I mean, it's not New York. New York is probably the most like, alright, serious, but DC, New York. But yeah, you went to two opposite places. That's cool. That is cool. Did you enjoy it? Did you enjoy the US? Are you like a, would you ever come back? Or do you think?

Kata: Yeah. Uh. I enjoyed it. I mean, I would go back when things are calm, I think. But that relates to not necessarily just stuff in the US, but in just general, you know.

You: Yeah. It's a little energy. In your life as well. You mean? Okay.

Kata: Yeah, I suppose. And it's just like, I guess for me, I'm more drawn to Asia because I lived in China for a bit and I really liked it. But I would love to... There's like, I would love to see New York. I would love to see honestly Vegas, but I don't know if I would have too much fun there. But there's a lot of places I would love to see. So like one day, I definitely would love to go.

You: And that's, yeah, I think there's, there's a few things. There's a few places where it's like, alright, you just pick a month or sometime in the future. You just hit the stuff, pop, pop, pop, check off all the stuff on the list. You enjoy. And then if you like it, well, you only need to do a couple, Grand Canyon when you're in Vegas. There's a couple of things. And then you're probably good on America as far as it goes. But I think everybody has their... I'm more Eastern Europe, but then food-wise, Asia. I just can't touch it, man. Can't touch it. I wanted to live in Hungary.

Kata: Yeah. As an Eastern European, I love Hungary. I seriously, I love our food, but yeah.

You: I honestly, Hungary is like the last place where I'm like, alright. Like if I move somewhere on purpose, I think it, I don't know how I'm into the countryside, but Budapest, there's just always some nonsense going on in Budapest. Always leave your apartment. There's just a beer festival. Just for no reason. Like who's planning these things? I have no idea, but you just go out and there's just a beer festival. There's just a parade. There's just, you know, they have the ruin bars and it's just, I don't think to be young. I'm 31. I'm just like, alright, I need one more. Like I want to live in one more place like that before I, I don't know if I'll ever quit everything. Right. And kids and all that shit. But it's like definitely want to live that vibe one more time.

Kata: Oh yeah. No, I get that.

You: Yeah. Uh no. Alright. I'll let you, I know I'm taking, I don't want to take too much of your time. We ran over a little bit. We will, we'll talk. I'm sure we'll have a chance to talk more in the future and you're a good personality, good person.

Kata: It... No, it was a lot of fun. Yeah, yes, oh this was a lot of fun. So thank you so much, and I'll get you the summary thing soon. But you will also have the transcription for the meeting link later as well.

You: And yeah, we'll talk. Yes. Yes, I think so. I think I asked. But I also took notes. But yeah, we'll. Just tap reference.

Kata: Question because yeah. It's good to have both little things. But yeah, thank you so much. And I'm really looking forward to this, so I hope that we end up working together.

You: Yes. Okay. See you. Okay.

Kata: Yes, goodbye. Thank you, see ya.

You: Thank you.
