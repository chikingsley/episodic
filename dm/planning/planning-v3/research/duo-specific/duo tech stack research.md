## Key Feature Patterns

Real-Time Interactive Items:
  Interactive Listening simulates a chat with animated characters, measuring comprehension, conversation, and summarization in one flow.
  Scripts and distractor responses are generated by large language models, not handcrafted.

GPT-4 Powered Pedagogy:
  Explain My Answer → instant personalized grammar breakdown when a learner errs (or even when they're right).
  Roleplay → open-ended chat framed as side-quests; scenario and first message are hand-written, then the LLM takes over and later grades the learner.

Lip-Sync at Scale:
  Pipeline: TTS → forced alignment → phoneme → viseme mapping → drive Rive state machine at runtime.
  Keeps files tiny and lets UX react instantly (e.g., stop talking if the learner moves on).

Relentless Experimentation:
  Every feature ships behind an experiment flag; internal service auto-creates buckets, dashboards, nightly stats; only promote if learning + engagement metrics win.
