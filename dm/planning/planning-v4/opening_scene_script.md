# Opening Scene

**FADE IN:**

## PRIVATE JET - 30,000 FEET - NIGHT

Ambient engine noise. The interior is luxurious but practical.

DRAKE (a Duck, the player character) is stretched out on a bench seat, half-asleep.

SHELDON (a Turtle) sits with headphones on, bobbing his head to music while reviewing files.

Sheldon's phone buzzes. He removes one headphone and answers.

**SHELDON:** Sheldon here. Secure line.

Pause

**SHELDON:** Yes, sir.

Pause

**SHELDON:** I understand.

Pause

**SHELDON:** Right away, sir.

Sheldon hangs up, stares at his phone for a moment, then puts his head in his hands.

**DRAKE:** (Sitting up) What's up?

**SHELDON:** (Gravely) They got Stella.

**DRAKE:** Huh? Who g...

**SHELDON:** (Agitated) Paris. She's been dark for 36 hours. Last transmission came from the 4th arrondissement.

**DRAKE:** Fuuuck. Soo... fuuuck, I mean well... who are they sending to go find her?

Sheldon looks up at Drake. The look says it all.

**DRAKE:** Nah.

**SHELDON:** Man...

## Choice Point 1

DRAKE is faced with a choice:

### Option 1: Drake says, "I'm not going to France bro."

**SHELDON:** (Interrupting) Lock the fuck in bro, it's not a fuckin debate. That was the Central Five on the phone.

**DRAKE:** One of the fucking Central Five called you?? Like Network Executives??

*Note for context: The Network is a secret group of spies that control the world's water supply. Sheldon and Drake are freelancers.*

The conversation then proceeds to the "Going to Paris" section below.

### Option 2: Drake asks, "Why us?"

**SHELDON:** You and I both know we're the best agents on this side of the world. Should be light work. Intel says it was the Syndicate... low level gang shit. Should be light work. What do you say?

Drake then has two ways to respond:

#### Sub-Option 2.A: Drake says, "I mean it's not like I have a choice."

**SHELDON:** Hey man. I'm sorry about this shit. Truly. But this is part of the job.

Drake sighs.

The conversation then proceeds to the "Going to Paris" section below.

#### Sub-Option 2.B: Drake says, "Nah, maaan, that's not the plan. You know I've been looking forward to Spain since..."

**SHELDON:** (Interrupting) Lock the fuck in bro, it's not a fuckin debate. That was the Central Five on the phone.

**DRAKE:** One of the fucking Central Five called you?? Like Network Executives??

*Note for context: The Network is a secret group of spies that control the world's water supply. Sheldon and Drake are freelancers.*

The conversation then proceeds to the "Going to Paris" section below.

## Going to Paris

Regardless of Drake's initial reluctance, they are now heading to Paris.

**SHELDON:** Man, this is next level shit. Something big is happening. Big big. And we'll find out when we touch down in 3 hours.

**DRAKE:** You are right but this sucks.

**SHELDON:** The real question is, how is your French? I think I remember your file saying you were fluent...

## Choice Point 2: French Proficiency

Drake must choose how to describe his French proficiency:

### Path A: Drake admits his French is not great

He can choose options like: "I'm new to French," "I know some common words," or "I can have basic conversations." This choice means a French language overlay system will be activated.

**DRAKE:** I may have exaggerated my proficiency on my agency profile...

**SHELDON:** Exaggerated how much?

**DRAKE:** (Jokingly) You know those neural contacts... they had just come out and I mean... they helped a lot...

**SHELDON:** (Incredulous) Soo...

**DRAKE:** I mean I can say bon jor (pronounces it in a very American way). Bon jor bon jor, voulez vous couchez avec moi... haha.

**SHELDON:** (Calmly) We're fucked.

**DRAKE:** (Defensive) I needed the fuckin work, okay! I'm good wi...

**SHELDON:** (Composed, interrupting) We're about to drop into a foreign fuckin country, ops crawling all over the city looking for idiots like us, and you don't speak French?!

**DRAKE:** (Thinking, then brightening) Wait, waitâ€”I have something.

Drake digs into his bag, then another bag, then another, and pulls out a sleek case containing high-tech contact lenses.

**DRAKE:** AHA! I still have them! Neural-linked contacts.

He taps his tablet, bringing up technical specs.

**DRAKE:** They'll connect to my optical nerve and cochlear implant. You'll see what I see, hear what I hear.

**SHELDON:** So?

**DRAKE:** So, you'll be my handler! I'll be in the field, but you'll pick the responses. The contacts have a translation overlay. You select the right French phrase, I repeat it.

**SHELDON:** That's your plan? Turn me into your puppetmaster?

**DRAKE:** Look, we've got 3 hours. The system has built-in training modules. You start learning now, then feed me lines when we land. I'll reprogram the system to store the words and phrases... Soon, I'll start recognizing patterns.

**SHELDON:** (Skeptical) Okay.. hmm.. okay. And if I pick wrong?

**DRAKE:** (Grimly) Cover blown. Mission compromised. Stella stays missing and we probably go missing too.

Sheldon considers, then sighs.

**SHELDON:** Fuck it. Give me that shit.

Drake hands over the tablet, grinning with relief.

**DRAKE:** (Jokingly sings) Voulez vous couchez av...

Sheldon shoves him hard, trying not to crack a smile.

**SHELDON:** This better work asshole. And work on your fucking accent.

**DRAKE:** By the way, the program tracks your progress with something called 'Cover Integrity.' Keep it above 25% or we're toast.

Sheldon looks at the tablet, sees "COVER INTEGRITY: 85%" displayed.

**SHELDON:** Alright, let's do this. Operation Dark Mallard is a go.

### Path B: Drake claims his French is good

He can choose options like: "Pretty solid! I can talk about various topics," or "My French is great! Nothing to worry about haha." This choice means the French language overlay system will be turned off.

**SHELDON:** Sick - this'll be a breeze then!

**DRAKE:** Honestly, I could take down more birds in Paris than I would have in Barcelona.

**SHELDON:** Sure man haha. First things first though... Let's find Stella. Here...

SHELDON hands Drake a tablet.

**SHELDON:** Even though it's good, it would be a good idea to brush up on some basics before we land.

## FADE TO BLACK

The story will continue with the next scene, presumably a French lesson or the arrival in Paris, referred to as "lsn_greetings_01".
