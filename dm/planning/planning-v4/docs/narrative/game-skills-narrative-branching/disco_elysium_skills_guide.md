## Meet the Skills: Intellect

February 13, 2017

In Metric (our character system) there are six skills that comprise your Intellect: Logic, Rhetoric, Drama, Encyclopedia, Conceptualization and Visual Calculus. They are represented here by their work-in-progress portraits.

### LOGIC

Logic is raw intellectual power. If you want to analyze the living daylights out of the case, take Logic. Formulate theories about what happened, or detect inconsistencies in the statements people make to you. It's useful for not getting bamboozled. Logic loves being right, however. To a fault. It's a brilliant lie detector until faced with intellectual flattery. Then it starts tooting its own horn. Your Drama skill might interfere: people are pretending, manipulating you, while Logic – blinded by its own brilliance – yammers on about how infallible it is. In heroic difficulty rolls, Logic can induce near-transcendence-like pleasure from performing raw operations on events and numbers. (It also does maths for you.) And it states the obvious. Logic loves an easy challenge, whatever it's claims.

### RHETORIC

Rhetoric is your ability to debate. Nitpick, make intellectual discourse. It doesn't need to be an argument, you can just shoot off your mouth and take hearty pleasure from it. But let's be honest – mostly Rhetoric just bickers. About politics. All political discourse falls under Rhetoric. You can mold it into a weapon of fascist sable rattling, evicting potato-loving kojkos and deformed himean pygmees left to right. Rid Revachol of aliens in transit! Or become the ultimate liberast (perpetrator of the sin of liberasty), extolling free trade and slimy personal freedoms at the expense of the downtrodden. This is achieved through researching political projects in your Thought Cabinet, then having them supercharge your Rhetoric skill. A souped up, ideologically informed Rhetoric is an impressive beast, but it gets you into trouble. The twist here is that Rhetoric – our persuasion ability – doesn't really persuade anyone. Most of the time it just makes you new enemies. While your beliefs calcify.

### ENCYCLOPEDIA

Encyclopedia is your knack for trivia. It's perhaps the talkiest of all the skills, pulling out drawers of fascinating if questionable tidbits of knowledge. Sometimes real nuggets of gold too. It's up to you to discern between the two. Encyclopedia adores brands, marks, makes of pistolette and motor-carriage, street names, addresses, species of cockatoo, Great Century military leaders, rock music icons, Messinian ceramic manufacturers … Buy it and max it out, if you want a deluge of lore. You may even find special, reoccurring places within your Encyclopedia. Like visions: a blackboard of names with all the cops in East Revachol on it, with all their confirmed kills and cases solved. Or a mysterious index of radio frequencies…

### DRAMA

Drama is a god damn liar. Deliver believable deviations from reality, sometimes with the goal to deceive people, but not necessarily. You may just want to entertain as well. We thought long and hard about how deceit is handled in RPGs and decided it needs to be more about performance in No Truce With The Furies. We want each of the skills to be a little world of it's own, an investment worth considering. So lying became stagecraft, an amalgam of fourberie and deceit, with entertainment – and even singing. You can do karaoke with Drama, or perform spot on imitations of people. Drama is also the counter to Drama. It informs you when Drama is being used on you. And although Intellect skills in general are more mentally oriented, Drama has its uses in combat as well. Feign death. Do drunken fighting. Maybe even quadrupedal movement…

### CONCEPTUALIZATION

Conceptualization is your capacity for original thought. Make fresh associations, really delve into the concepts of the world – from Jan Kaarp's postmodernist karperie, to Revachol's arabesque architectural style dideridada, or even the concept of hardcore as deployed by the burgeoning dance music scene – then add your own contribution to these works! It's your general purpose cultural theorist, used for both criticism and creation. Okay, I'll level with you. Conceptualization makes you into an Art Cop. You get extra lines of description in scenes, and you get to come up with stuff like poems, one-liners and a cool nom de guerre for yourself. An artist's name, if you will. Conceptualization is the difference between hanging yourself and jumping into a live volcano. (No literal live volcanos are present in No Truce With The Furies for the time being.)

### VISUAL CALCULUS

Visual Calculus is your forensics skill. It represents your grasp of the laws of physics, motion particularly. Create models of past events in your mind's eye, trace dotted lines across the room, read tire tracks to recreate an automobile accident. Even notice tactical opportunities in combat situations – then take advantage of them. (Perception + Visual Calculus = the ultimate sniper) We're building a special, stylistic overlay that covers the world when certain Visual Calculus checks succeed. This lets us visualize shards of glass falling out of the window, a car backing into the fence, or political prisoners standing in front of a firing squad, half a century ago… all painted into the isometric world around you. It looks great and I'm really sorry we haven't shown it off yet. Just a few more tweaks first though… I'm going to be candid and say Visual Calculus is a really cool skill and you should probably take it if you don't want to miss out on all the cool. The only reason not to take it is that it's a luxury. You need more essential stuff to stay alive and on top of things.

So to wrap it up – Intellect does not make you get on well with yourself, or with other people. It lets you peel off layer after layer from the world, getting to its inner workings, modelling its events and bending it's structures. If that's what you want, stick five or six points into it at character creation and later buy two or three skills to boot. It's been my ambition as a pen and paper DM to make heavy mental labour as engaging and wildly entertaining as combat, or even more so. Of the four main Attributes, Intellect was perhaps the hardest to nail. What it really comes down to is how the actual situations are written in the game — and most of all, how interestingly you play them out. The skills are just prompters in the play you're starring in, whispering suggestions to you from within. It's up to you to decide whose ideas you want more of, and what to do with them. But naming and dividing between areas of juristiction is everything in systems — and I'm certain this cast was worth getting together all these years. (Next time we'll introduce the Psyche skills to you. Inland Empire is my favourite.)

## Meet the Skills: Psyche

**Olga Moskvina**  
*Writer*  
March 13, 2018

In a previous blog post, Lead Designer Robert Kurvitz introduced the Intellect skills, which allow you carve up the world every which way, and assemble new and wondrous things from the pieces. Now I'll talk about the six Psyche skills — Volition, Inland Empire, Empathy, Authority, Suggestion, and Esprit de Corps. Generally speaking, these six unstable dudes will make you into a more sensitive person. This is both good and bad. Of all our four Attributes, Psyche is the most schizophrenic. You will be a magnetic personality able to pick up on other people's feelings, a powerhouse of imagination and charisma. But this will also make you a greater burden on yourself.

### VOLITION

Volition is the foundational skill for Psyche, as Logic is for Intellect. However, while Logic may sometimes succumb to the temptation of intellectual arrogance, Volition is more consistent in getting you out of trouble. It's your inner good guy. Volition is all about having a moral compass and the willpower to resist temptations — from the sweet smell of liquor to unsavory urges. Yes, you can bear the profound tragedy of human existence, Volition tells you. No, you do not need to take a swig from that bottle of vodka to help you do it. And when your ego is being inflated by self-congratulation and flattery (say Logic and Authority are having a big old party in your attic, egging each other on), Volition intervenes to cut you down to size before you do something abominably stupid because you're feeling almighty. Volition is the party pooper. It's also the skill associated with your Morale — one of the two life bars in the game, along with Health. It represents your will to finish the investigation, redeem yourself in the eyes of others. Run out of Morale and you'll give up in a series of excruciating "I don't wanna be a cop any more scenes" where your friends get exceedingly tired of talking you back from the ledge.

### INLAND EMPIRE

Inland Empire is your unfiltered emotions, dreams, and forebodings. Basically, Inland Empire has a lot of interesting (read: wrong) ideas about the world. It lets you know when there might be something mysterious or spooky going on. Why would you want to be just a regular old cop when you could be a para-natural detective, groping your way through invisible dimensions of reality? it asks you. (Inland Empire is, after all, the Lynchian skill.) Inland Empire can also offer helpful hints via gut reactions – though you can never be sure when and to what extent to trust its enigmatic messages. Of all the skills in the game, Inland Empire has been one of the wildest to write, since it also represents your uncontrollable imagination. When Conceptualization under Intellect is an art critic, Inland Empire is an unwitting creator. It turns inanimate objects animate and lets you have conversations with your gun, the corpse of the deceased – maybe even one of your items of clothing. The information it provides may prove right… in retrospect.

### EMPATHY

Empathy is your ability to pick up on subtle cues that indicate that something is happening beneath the surface of other characters. Not that they're lying to you, exactly — Drama (under Intellect) is your go-to for picking up on lies. Rather, Empathy lets you know when there's more to the story than meets the eye. Perhaps a hidden sadness that a good detective should be able to coax out of the people he's questioning. Or hidden resentment toward the detective himself. Have too little of Empathy and you turn into an ungainly beast who is unable to read basic social circumstances and may or may not be forced to become a virulent… well, let's just say, you may not have as much control over some of your politics as you'd like. Empathy is not all honesty and feelings, it's also a basic social survival skill that makes you come off as caring and emotionally intelligent. (Even if you're not!)

### AUTHORITY

Authority is the skill that likes to fly into a rage when it feels like you and your profession aren't being RESPECTED. It constantly urges you to reassert your dominance over those around you. Was there a hint of sarcasm in that elderly scientist's "It's a pleasure to meet you, officer?" Demand that he change his tone, or else! Every so often, Authority also supplies useful information. For example, it can help you understand the power dynamics of a group of thugs, or let you know how far you can push someone before they push back. But, to be honest, it's mostly about displays of self-assertion, which are quite important in police work. Authority is perhaps the craziest skill to have little of. Yell at teenagers, start crying while you're angry, verbally abuse your partner to no avail. Threaten to arrest people, then back off. If you constantly fail at asserting yourself as a police officer, you run the risk of becoming the fabled Meltdown Cop.

### SUGGESTION

Suggestion is the skill of manipulators and charmers. Need to talk someone into something or out of something? Suggestion will hint at the right approach to take. In contrast to baton-flailing Authority, Suggestion is all about soft power — why threaten someone when you can make them believe their interests are aligned with yours instead? You've just gotta find the right words, man. Suggestion also lets you know when someone is trying to charm you, for whatever reason. Maybe it's just an innocent flirtation – but how can you be sure? Suggestion is also what people in Brittain call a slimey-limey. It's oleaginous, even when it succeeds. And when it fails… oh boy. If you thought failing at Authority was bad, try failing at Suggestion, Casanova Cop. Aka Copponova. Aka Romeo Returns Alone.

### ESPRIT DE CORPS

Esprit De Corps is your "meanwhile, back at the ranch" skill. It's distinct from all the other skills in Metric in that it supplies the player with information that is beyond the scope of the protagonist's present experience. Not in a para-natural way – rather, as literature. Esprit de Corps produces flash-sideways mini novellas of your cop friends, doing their cop stuff while you do yours. Thus it draws parallels between your travails and those of your fellow officers all throughout Revachol. Esprit de Corps represents your connection to the RCM – Revachol Citizen's Militia – the police force you're a part of. And, more specifically, your Station – Precinct 41. Esprit de Corps also looks in on your partner, Kim Kitsuragi, when he happens to be away. Thus, this system allows us to show what your party member is doing when he's not in the party. Take this skill if you like postmodern trickery. It's a luxury skill, of course. But we see great potential for it in future titles. Esprit de Corps tells you: it's not all about you. There are other stories happening parallel to yours. There's a constellation of cops out there, solving cases, giving up and picking themselves up again…

That's the gang this time around. Max out on Psyche in character creation, and these skills will argue, fight, and play tug-of-war with one another, attempting to make you follow this or that irrational impulse. It'll be a blast, but make sure to buckle up! A high Psyche goes well with most builds. Combine it with high Fysique for an absolute raving mad man. Or high Intellect for a mental bastion. Or high Motorics for one cool cat and charismatic leader. Till next time!

## Meet the Skills: Physique

**Robert Kurvitz**  
*Game Designer*  
April 11, 2018

These six skills are probably my favourites of the whole bunch. They were certainly the hardest to come up with. We finished Physique (FYS) while already deep into production, whereas the other three were ready years before. It's surprisingly difficult to depict the physicality of a character – their flesh, blood and tendons – in a rule set. This is reflected in RPG tradition, where physical characters are one dimensional musclemen, somewhere between an athlete and a joke. It's paradoxical how uninteresting it is to play a physical character in a genre that is built around them – nothing interesting happens inside the body of Conan the Barbarian. This was our starting point: what kind of physical character would we want to play in a desktop setting? They would have to be murky, dangerous, sinewy beings. Mysteries even to themselves. More Nameless One than Torgen the Axe-Dude. To achieve this we had to come up with a set of skills that is – surprisingly – the most esoteric and out there of all the four Attributes. Instead of getting the most basic experience, you get probably the most advanced and experimental playing with a high FYS char. Physique skills are also the most silent of the bunch. They don't speak as often as INT for example. But the times your body does speak to you hold more weight.

### PHYSICAL INSTRUMENT

Physical Instrument is your primary corporeal tool: your muscles and your skeleton. Physical Instrument is your hand to hand combat skill, your inner coach. He likes to be addressed as "Coach Physical Instrument". You can call him Coach, or you can call him Coach Physical Instrument. Put points into this guy to punch a suspect in the face. Or 360 degree spin kick the living daylights out of them. But it's not just violence. You can use this skill to physically analyse the qualities of a "beat" on a dance track. (Coach Physical Instrument thinks it needs more bass). In addition to being the voice of your musculature, Physical Instrument tries to give you social advice from time to time: be less sensitive, stop being such a sissy, drop down and give me fifty. Coach Physical Instrument is all about masculinity, with little to no self awareness. I like to think it governs your muscles, skeleton and your sweat glands. Add Suggestion to dial things back a little, add some sensitivity training? He turns you into a raging gym trainer if you let him run the show.

### ELECTROCHEMISTRY

Physical Instrument is nothing compared to Electrochemistry, who turns you into a lecherous drug addict. I'll level with you – it's one of the funnest skills in the game. Not only does it crave for any and all substances on Earth, it's also a treasure trove of knowledge on each of them. For some reason this cop knows exactly what GABA receptors do, what serotonin syndrome means, and what kind of cocaine the Filippian kings did four centuries ago. But beware – Electrochemistry also governs your other dopamine responses. That is: your sexuality. Electrochemistry inserts lurid thoughts into your head, with absolutely no filter. It does not play nice either, it's an animal. Yet it has its own atmospheric, ruinous take on reality. You should exercise caution with this guy and make sure you have some Volition to keep things in check. Having low Electrochemistry makes you a calmer person, more in control of yourself. Having high Electrochemistry makes you not turn up to work the following day, yet more fun to be around after 10PM. It also has a nice mechanical function. Disco Elysium lets you use potions (ie drugs) mid-dialogue. Equip cigarettes in one hand and a vial of speed in the other. Encounter a difficult check? Spark one up and then toot a line! (In secret of course, turn around a bit first – it'd be pretty strange if a cop just did a line in front of you wouldn't it?) Blasting a substance gives you a cute little animation and adds a temporary bonus to your Attributes. Alcohol gives +2 to Physique, for example. Electrochemistry adds extra charges to these items, so a high Electrochemistry character gets more out of their drugs. The skill also leads you down a path of substance abuse, giving you quests to procure amphetamine, or just buy a magnum sized bottle of wine. These quests are often non-refusable.

### ENDURANCE

Endurance is your metabolism and your circulatory system. It's what keeps you alive. Endurance determines the amount of health points you have. Health is our primary resource pool, in addition to morale. Run out of health and you have a heart attack. Have too many heart attacks and you die. (It's a known fact that cool cops can shake off one or two cardiac arrests like it weren't a thing). Endurance makes you a more robust person. The more robust a person you are, the more fun you can have. And by fun I mean drugs and silly things. Remember that vial of speed you sniffed? In addition to depleting charges, it straight up damages your health. There are medicines to heal yourself up, of course. I hear doing magnesium, GABA-max, speed and the psychedelic anti-radiation drug Pyrholidone is great, because you get to feel like a superhuman, have beautiful visions and there are NO DOWNSIDES! (Until you run out of magnesium and GABA-max). This mad scientist's lab is one of Disco Elysium's more strategic elements. If it turns out the way we intend it to, it should be a pretty fun balancing act. And you get to do more of it if you have a high Endurance. So far so normal. Until you find out that Endurance is also your gut feeling. And what your gut feeling tells you is – immigrants are bad for the economy. There are varied multistage reasons why women get paid less. You should return Revachol to the likeness of the Holy Sun In The Sky. Yes. If you play a certain way you may find out this guy's a fascist, much like the Rhetoric skill under INT tends to be a little socialist…

### HALF LIGHT

Fear! Aggression! Half Light is your fight or flight response. This one's definitely the chattiest of the bunch. Not only does he mix well with a high Physical Instrument, telling you to smash everyone in the face before they strangle you in your sleep, Half Light also has some pretty keen observations. There is a saying in Estonian: fear has big eyes. So Half Light and its big bulging fear-filled eyes may notice things the other skills miss. Half Light does not only get scared of people, it also gets scared of ideas and concepts. Sometimes a person's name can fill you with terror. Why? Perhaps they're more than they seem to be. Perhaps you're paranoid? One of the nicest things to do with Half Light is aggressively interrogate suspects. Barraging them with nonsensical, frightening questions: did you kill him? Why did you kill him? Are you going to kill me like you killed him?! A low Half Light, strangely enough, makes you both less aggressive and less afraid. In a way braver.

### PAIN THRESHOLD

Pain Threshold lets you shake off that heart attack I mentioned, like it was nothing – a pin prick. It's your get out of jail free card for physical damage – it's what makes you crawl forward, bloodied, ready for revenge. Pain Threshold also doubles as your inner masochist. You like this stuff. Please, can I have some more? And not only physical pain, but also psychological. Pain Threshold seeks it out and enjoys it. Painful memories? Nice. Excuse me, bookstore woman, what's the most excruciatingly sad book about human relations you have? I want one where they love each other but it really doesn't work out. High Pain Threshold turns you into a pretty unhealthy person, paradoxically.

### SHIVERS

Shivers is the strangest one out there and it's proven to be a favourite for many people who've had the chance to play the game for longer. You know those hair follicles you have on your arm, on the back of your neck? Notice how they stand up sometimes? Accompanied by a cold sensation? Shivers controls that – your shiver response. It's a residual leftover from hundreds of thousands of years ago, when you had a use for it… What it does now, in the city of Revachol, in the early fifties, I can't tell you. It's a secret. This skill has its own storyline. The signals your shiver response relays to you seem to come from somewhere. The sensations want to tell you something. All I can tell you is – Shivers connects you to the atmosphere of the city of Revachol. To the side alleys and the burnt down city blocks far away. It's the sound of the streets, the ghost that rises old newspapers from the cobblestones. It turns you into a lightning rod for sudden temperature shifts, barometrics and changes in weather. Shivers even reacts to the weather our randomly generated climate system summons. If it's raining Shivers tells you one thing, if it's snowing, it'll tell you another. Ultimately, a high Shivers lets you hear and feel the city of Revachol. It is the only clearly supra-natural ability you have in the game. Figuring out what it all means and who speaks to you through those rising hair follicles, is a mystery for you to solve. I suspect it will take quite a few playthroughs, though. This game really has a crazy amount of little things hidden in the way the skill system reacts to the things you see and do in Revachol.

Coming soon – Motorics. The cool, down to Earth counterpart to Physiques' unholy mysteries.

## Meet the Skills: Motorics

**Robert Kurvitz**  
*Game Designer*  
May 29, 2018

Motorics (MOT) covers your peripheral nervous system, your five senses, and your vestibular system. It's our take on the classic Dexterity and Perception stats, but not only. Motorics also has an added mental aspect – your street smarts, the ability to think on your feet and maintain a poker face in stressful situations. Above all, the Motorics skills make you cool. And, unlike the other skill sets, they don't come at a huge cost. Put too many points into Physique and it turns you into a violent animal – something like Marv from Sin City. Overdo Psyche and you're Dale Cooper on MDMA. Too much Intellect turns you a Holmesian pedant. The twist with Motorics is – there is no such twist. Ultra high levels of the Motorics skills surprise you with expanded functionality. It's the stabilizing element of your build, the binding agent. A high Motorics cop is one smart, streetwise operator, closest to the classic Detective archetype: your Johnny Dollar or Sonny Crockett. It's also the flashiest attribute animation-wise, and definitely the best-dressed. Which is not to say that the Motorics skills make you perfect. You may come off as jumpy or high strung. A bit of a cokehead, even. But, honestly, that's nothing compared to the trouble you can get into with the other three. Let's have a look at what these six desperados can do for you.

### HAND / EYE COORDINATION

H/E, as we shorten it, makes you fire that gun. Makes you fire it good. The more H/E you have, the more precise your aim. And, be it a Villiers 9mm, a Kiejl Armistice, or a banged up old Liljeqist in your hand, you're going to want to be very precise, because bad, bad, very bad things will happen if you aren't. Not only is H/E for aiming, or throwing – it's also for catching. You'd be surprised how useful that is. Your partner just threw you the keys to your patrol vehicle. It's a cool moment, but Benny Shitfingers drops them in the sewage. Vehicle inoperable. Mob boss flips a coin in your direction: here's a tip rent-a-cop. Blam, he pokes your eye out with it. It's incredibly uncool to not catch things. Oh and remember when I said it's for using firearms? Well, the twist here is: it also analyzes them. Pick up a gun and H/E will tell you things about it: weight, calibre, reliable range. Good to have in a murder investigation if firearms are involved. And they always are. Revachol is a very gunny place.

### REACTION SPEED

Reaction Speed also gets a little gunny. Lets you dodge incoming gunfire. It's the yang to H/E's yin. The anti-gun. Your danger sense. Your dodge skill. On the mental side of things, it's also your mental alacrity and street smarts. It helps you dodge snipes of the verbal sort: quick jabs and cheap shots, dramatic moves people try to pull on you. Reaction Speed is an alarm system. Overdo levelling this one and you'll develop that jumpiness I mentioned. Surely a small price to pay for not being, you know, dead. Or standing there with your mouth agape, trying to come up with a cool comeback after the she's already gone. If you want to build a mental powerhouse, max up on INT Skills like Logic, Conceptualization and Visual Calculus, then throw Reaction Speed in there too. They'll call you Johnny Big-Brain now! It's possible to be very intelligent without it, but it's a slow, studious intellect. Reaction Speed gives you smarts. I's perhaps the quintessential hardboiled detective skill in the game…

### PERCEPTION

…second only to Perception. This one's a giant. It's the magnifying glass in your hand that allows you to see the drop of blood in the fish tank. The keen ear that catches the sound of breathing under the floorboards. Perception governs your sight, smell, taste, and hearing. Because it's so all-encompassing, it's better to say what it doesn't do. Perception does not read tells and body language (that's Composure, another Motorics skill). And it doesn't detect microscopic details with your fingertips (that's Interfacing, another one). But you're still going to want to put a few points into this one, believe me. And, yes, it does yield clues too. A lot of clues. Even too many, perhaps? A high Perception cop is going to be drowning in little notes about the things they saw, heard, or smelled – some of them extraneous, or even misleading. But still, be careful – too little of this one and you'll be on an experimental playthrough of Disco Elysium: The Adventures of Johnny Blind. Perception does all sorts of nice things outside of dialogue too, affecting how you interact with the game's ultra-detailed art. It detects hidden containers for you to loot, and reveals hidden objects in the world – footprints on the floor, for example. Then you can use Visual Calculus (an Intellect skill) to read their size, make and so on – another example of Intellect and Motorics having great synergy for a classic detective build. Also, expect to find hidden areas: secret rooms, doors, and rooftop paths in the city of Revachol. The city's also littered with these little green orbs you can click on; classic "question mark" moments that provide quick observations like: "someone left the stove on," "water's dripping from this tap." Some of these orbs are only visible to higher Perception characters. You can use these hidden, golden orbs to question people: "You just renovated, but the tap's leaking?" This is one more way environmental exploration (crime scene analysis) and questioning people (interrogations) are connected in Disco Elysium. Finally, there are certain Thought Cabinet projects that allow you to auto-succeed, say, all hearing-type Perception checks. So there are workarounds for a low Motorics character who wants to play the "blind saxophone player" cop. (Please don't. Also, there are no saxophones in Elysium.)

### SAVOIR FAIRE

Savoir Faire is all about style, subterfuge, flair. Even sexiness to a certain extent. It's our combined Acrobatics and Sneaking skill, with an added zest of verbal flare every now and then. The full package for a slippery roguish detective. You're basically a ninja-cop, or what our worldbuilding calls a Sambo artist. (Sambo, short for Samaran Boxing, is a communist martial art from Sapurmat Ulan.) You may also be… a bit of a douchebag, to be honest. A police detective who sneaks out of conversations and pulls acrobatic moves can come off as an exhibitionist. The other Motorics skills affect your personality in surprisingly (for the Metric system) agreeable ways, but this one's a wild card. On the other hand, it's extremely useful for sneaking into places. It lets you interact with the game's environment in some pretty flashy ways, where our combat system blends into an acrobatics system for jumping, climbing, etc. The twist here — and the importance of this cannot be overstated — is that Savoir Faire also lets you dance.

### COMPOSURE

Composure is your poker face. The Motorics firewall for your inner turmoil. And also its reverse – your ability to read other people's body language and tells – to see beneath their facade. Composure and Perception go well together, making for an ultra-vigilant cop. Composure and the Psyche skill Volition are a good combination for a man of steel who never cracks under pressure. And you'll be under a lot of pressure in Disco Elysium. Or, if you want to be the expert in reading people, combining Composure with another Psyche skill, Empathy, gives you X-Ray vision into people's mental states. If Savoir Faire sexes you up in a slightly douchey way, Composure does the stomach-in, shoulders-back type thing. A trustworthy sexiness. Great posture. The big twist here is that very high Composure becomes your fashion sense. First of all, it criticises other people's sartorial choices – not only are they sweating and obviously hiding something, they also have a lame floral shirt. Second, it lets you push your fashion sense on them. Make your partner wear a stupid orange pilot cap. You look too cool for others to not trust your advice.

### INTERFACING

Interfacing is the final piece of the puzzle as your fine motor skills. Digital dexterity. Fingerworks. Oh boy, does this one do a lot of things — it basically does all the rest: takes notes and helps with handwriting analysis; interprets electrical circuitry; instructs you on how to use a simple blue button; runs your hands across the gear shaft of a motor-carriage; disentangles a Stereo 8 tape from a hawthorn tree, patches it up, and plays it at night on your short stint as a tape-jockey; runs diagnostics on a motor lorry; picks locks; does a great massage; finds microscopic tears in body cavities… In some extreme cases (very high Interfacing needed), you can even perform what we call a phenomenological transfer: put your hands on the steering levers (motor-cars in Elysium do not use wheels) of a Coupris Kineema and know precisely what its mileage is, how it was treated by its last owner, and what road it was last driven on. Interfacing is one of those rare skills in the Metric system that sometimes borders on the extraphysical. Extraphysical is what we call the realistically supernatural. The real deal. Reality-breaking. Interfacing's extraphysical effects are much, much more subtle than those of the Physique skill Shivers, which puts you in touch you with the city of Revachol, but they're there, connecting you to machinery, electrical circuits, and, most curiously, radiowaves. You see, in Disco Elysium you can circuit-bend into radiocomputers. These machines have on-air processing. Large prime number stations criss-cross the air. Advanced tape computers use arrays of antennas to sieve through their calculations to perform advanced calculus on site: to run programmes and communicate between the remote corners of the world. There's a Ream A24 Prefect console somewhere down there, in a hidden basement – or a church, who can say? – that you can use to circuit-bend into remote units. Access personal information, read love letters, learn ancient secrets. Tape computation has existed in this world for hundreds of years. Who knows what you'll find… Oh, what's that, mom? What am I doing? I'm playing a seventies-style cop with a handlebar moustache who frequency-hacks into ancient radio stations. It's not basic dungeons and dragons.

That's all for Metric, the system that powers character creation in Disco Elysium. We hope you've enjoyed these posts and have gotten some interesting ideas for your build. Next time we'll talk about the Thought Cabinet, where you develop character traits for your cop, giving your skills new and strange sideeffects. After that we'll finally be ready to talk about the Elysium setting – its technology, geopolitics, schools of thought, and culture. Till then.

## Writing Like Disco

Notes by Kawa on writing in the style of Disco Elysium

These notes are by Kawa, on things to keep in mind as a writer while using the Disco Elysium macros to write in the style of the game! See TwineTips.md for information about things like variables and logic - these are about tone and writing style.

Please note that while I have been functionally living in this text for many months now, this is not meant to be an absolute Word of God canonical style guide - just observations I've made when trying to write in the style of the game.

### Spelling/Jargon Notes

The macros use the following spelling for the skills:

INTELLECT

- Conceptualization
- Drama
- Encyclopedia
- Logic
- Rhetoric
- Visual Calculus

PSYCHE

- Authority
- Empathy
- Esprit De Corps
- Inland Empire
- Suggestion
- Volition

FYSIQUE

- Electrochemistry
- Endurance
- Half Light
- Pain Threshold
- Physical Instrument
- Shivers

MOTORICS

- Composure
- Hand/Eye Coordination
- Interfacing
- Reaction Speed
- Savoir Faire
- Perception
- Perception (Smell)
- Perception (Sight)
- Perception (Taste)
- Perception (Touch)
- Perception (Hearing)

Note particularly the slash in "Hand/Eye Coordination", the space in "Half Light", the spelling of "Esprit de Corps", and the specific senses for "Perception" in parentheses (as well as a version with no sense specified). Touch technically doesn't show up in the game at all, but it's included in the macros for completeness. Of course, for custom games using the framework but not the canonical skills, you can edit these to be whatever you like in the `StoryInit` passage.

While they're not hard-coded in the macros, these are the difficulties used in the game, with the numbers they're assigned to:

- **Trivial**: 6-7
- **Easy**: 8-9
- **Medium**: 10-11
- **Challenging**: 12
- **Formidable**: 13
- **Legendary**: 14
- **Heroic**: 15
- **Godly**: 16
- **Impossible**: 18-20

The macros will take care of the format for individual passive checks within the game, but as a reference for the text of skill checks (which the writer will have to make manually using `AddOption`), they look like this:

```text
<<AddOption "[SkillName - Difficulty ##] Text of your option here.">>
```

where 'Difficulty' is one of the words above and ## has the number from the list.

### About Options

The macros consider the options as if they're being done by YOU, which matches the game's rendering. So `<<AddOption "Say nothing.">>` will put "YOU - Say nothing." at the start of the next passage. This means if you want the passage to start with your protagonist saying something out loud, you'll need extra quotes: `<<AddOption "\"Hello, I've said something.\"">>` will put "YOU - "Hello, I've said something."" at the start of the next passage.

A mix of action and dialogue uses parentheses: `<<AddOption "(Reach over to shake their hand.) \"Pleased to meet you!\"">>>`

Even someone interrupting you, done by an option, is done with YOU as the speaker. `<<AddOption "Kim is about to say something. Let him.">>`

Note that if you want the text of your option to be variable, you must use global variables (that start with `$`). More about global versus local variables in TwineTips.md.

### Voicing and Tone

The general concept of the skill dialogues are a Greek chorus/internal monologue, split up into parts. Most of their tone and observations are about "you"; what you (the protagonist) should be doing and perceiving. Skill voices rarely use first person; they can when distressed, though. They also can acknowledge each other, but not necessarily by name, and usually do not directly argue with each other. (But can contradict!)

A high INT protagonist loves trivia (Encyclopedia) and feeling "right" about things (Rhetoric, Conceptualization). INT introduces the protagonist to communism.

A high PSY protagonist is empathetic and doesn't listen to their worst impulses (Volition), but also cares a good deal about power - both hard (Authority) and soft (Suggestion). PSY introduces the protagonist to centrism, known as "moralism".

A high FYS protagonist is focused on machismo and fear, but also has a deep empathy for the world as a whole (Shivers) and can sense emotional alongside physical pain (Pain Threshold). FYS introduces the protagonist to fascism.

A high MOT protagonist observes the world and wants to *appear* cool and calm (Savoir Faire, Composure). MOT introduces the protagonist to high capitalism, known as "Ultraliberalism".

#### Specific Skills Worth Noting

**Esprit de Corps** is special, it's capable of flash-sideways for the reader of what other cops are doing at the time when thematically relevant. The protagonist may or may not actually be aware of what Esprit de Corps knows - the game mentions places and names the protagonist claims to not remember!

**Electrochemistry** is rude. It's a hangover, it's an addiction, it's swinging by the liquor store and deciding to enter, despite an earlier promise to yourself. Electrochemistry also seems to be tied to impulse more generally - allowing yourself to be distracted by stories about cryptids from an old lady is an Electrochemistry check. Electrochemistry likes using metaphors involving Disco, dancing, and partying - particularly equating them to substance use and sexual pleasure.

**Inland Empire** can carry specific images and fragments of emotional memory. It's melancholic and profound and has lots to say, but expresses it in strange, broken ways.

**Conceptualization** also has images, and is the seat of metaphor and simile.

**Shivers** has a rather specific structure for its longer passages. I'll let Alexei take it from here:

> Shivers is grounded in physical sensation - particularly a cold or chill kind of one, and something that comes from the environment. Damp, or wind, or wet - something physically uncomfortable but not painful, especially something kind of draining, like draining of heat. It's something kind of cutting because it draws your attention to that sensation in the moment, like the chill to your body and the literal shiver cuts through what's going on in your mind at the time. It's a very immediate and physical sensation.
>
> But - because it's coming from the environment, the contrast is that while it's a very immediate physical sensation, it then draws your attention outwards to where the sensation comes from, which places you in the moment and space of where you are in the world.
>
> So it's a hyperawareness of exactly where you are in time and space, but also a zooming out - your consciousness draws in due to the sensation, but then kind of leaches out and is carried with the wind or the rain that triggered the feeling. You feel a sense of connection, like you are part of something bigger. Not in quite as human a way as Empathy or Esprit de Corps, or as supernatural as Inland Empire - but it's like you're part of the city, of a moment in time in this complex image of all these little details coming together.
>
> Once it's zoomed out, Shivers continues to offer a contrast in that on that scale, it lets your mind roam over aspects - usually moving in directions, like to the north and the south - or even "directions" in time, to the past and to the future. You are in this frozen moment and examining it in a somewhat detached but connected way, looking at the whole and then choosing portions to focus in on before zooming back out. And when you do focus in, it picks up on little evocative snapshots, things that are frozen in the moment and are also part of this connected system. Something like a newspaper blowing in the wind - it's part of the wind, the story is part of the city, the paper is for the day which invokes thoughts of time.
>
> It looks at *people*. It has senses of connection and of a whole, of the little pieces that all come together to make up this city, the feeling that in this very moment and every moment like it there are people and things happening everywhere that are beautiful and evocative and important and that you will never be able to see because they happen everywhere all the time, and all you have to look at is this moment.
>
> So you do this contrast, the focusing in on aspects of the big zoomed out picture, the focusing in giving you little pieces that are rooted in connection and in time and place - and then once you have seen what you can see of this moment, you make the decision to allow yourself to return to your body and let the world continue to flow.
>
> To summarize:
>
> 1. Start with a harsh physical sensation from the environment that pulls your attention in to this moment then pulls it out to the environment that's causing it
> 2. Zoom out to a wide picture of the surroundings that's grounded in some sense of direction along an axis (time, space, etc)
> 3. Examine evocative tableaus that zoom back in, and especially imagery that brings to mind connection to the city and to this moment in time/space/history/etc
> 4. wrap it up with a conscious decision to return to your mind and let the world keep flowing again

### YOU and Objects

A useful trick when writing in the Disco Elysium style is to take advantage of setting the speaker to YOU or to objects in the world.

The writer can use YOU for actions, dialogue, and internal monologue, particularly in response to things the skills say.

Objects can and also should be a "speaker" when the player interacts with them. Particularly with high Inland Empire (or Interfacing for technological objects), the protagonist may be able to sense things about the object beyond its physical attributes, and the writer can include these by using the object as the speaker.

### Tasks and XP

XP can be gained through tasks and secret tasks. Generally 'secret task' XP, that's not telegraphed with an earlier "New Task", is higher than regular task XP.

Task names are generally short commands - "Ask Kim to tell you about the case" - or objects to investigate "The victim's tattoos". They can also be questions - "Who made the call reporting the crime?"

XP values are always multiples of 5.

A level up happens in *Disco Elysium* when the player has gained 100 XP.
