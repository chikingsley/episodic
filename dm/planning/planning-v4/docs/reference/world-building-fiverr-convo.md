## Language Learning Game Development Conversation

## May 29, 2025

### 1:30 AM - Me

So it's story development, high level, with drilling into how specifically different missions / units can potentially be setup with examples.

### 1:31 AM - Jo S

So it's basically fleshing out gameplay more and how to integrate a story to make it more interesting to learn the language?

### 1:32 AM - Jo S

I personally only speak/write french and english, so I can help out for these languages, but not others!

### 1:35 AM - Me

Yes basically - and yeh that works! Yeh it's perfect, French was going to be the first language haha. The concept would ultimately be something language agnostic that could be iterated on in different ways with other languages (in some wonderful successful future haha) but yeh, perfect to be able to cook up ideas / examples specifically in French.

### 1:37 AM - Jo S

Sure, I have some experience working with people who teach French as a second language, so I could probably suggest some interesting learning tools, I just have to brush off my knowledge on that part (game design is what I usually do as a job so that part is fine).

### 1:40 AM - Jo S

Would it be like the same story/gameplay for each language or would you have it have variation depending on the language?

### 1:49 AM - Me

Couple visions - I lean more towards different story / varied gameplay for each language, like possibly. But that's already a bit too large - for now and for this, I'd be happy making something sick for specifically English speakers learning French from zero.. but I guess your specialty is world-building haha. So it would be fun to have a full full idea (or beginning of one to iterate on) where future CEO me can pick some of the mechanics/mini-games and adapt them based on the language. I think the central learning mechanisms would be the same - the audio lessons / speak + repeat grammar stuff. Where possibly implicit/explicit grammar stuff could change based on language and then some of the gamification could vary. I was thinking for each language, the characters would be based in a new city, new adversary/mystery etc.

### 1:56 AM - Me

I mean I'm even leaning more towards, each language is a new game/app - so each is a separate experience that's developed specifically for that. Little extra love and care for each with some teacher consultation. "Dark Mallard: French Heist", "Dark Mallard: Lost in the Pyramids" or some shi lol have fun with it. Have some character mocks - wanted it to be cartoon animals, more gritty and edgy than the godking Duolingo but also simple enough to be animate-able. Attached a few characters that I've been playing with.. ignore the UI but yeh kinda you can start to get some energy of what it is.

### 1:58 AM - Me

There's an Unreal Engine idea / concept but wanted to try some iterations on a mobile type game before going full platformer.

### 2:09 AM - Jo S

I do a lot of world-building yes, but I can also give some direction on gameplay loop and possible learning material/game/exercise.

### 2:18 AM - Me

Perfect - yeh so what would be best way to move forward? You want to do a custom project where I can send all my ideas and you can start your process or paid consult on Zoom to brainstorm / catch vibes first?

### 3:34 AM - Jo S

We can do a custom project, you can send me your things and I can start to check what you have! I usually go with a per word-based thing, but it doesn't really fit this specific work, so it would probably be better to do more of an hourly thing, and depending on your budget I can spend more or less time on it to help you!

### 3:58 AM - Me

Cool, let's do that - for budget, I like your existing tiers in the concepts / world-building. Would that $165 buy enough time to play with the ideas and get into your process? Interested in getting some sketches from you as well, especially once the vision, gameplay, story is developed more.

### 4:06 AM - Jo S

Sure, that would give me quite a bit of time to start the process, check out what you have and start expanding more on what you have. Since it's quite the start of the whole project it would probably be more checking what you have, putting it in order, try to find some sort of narrative and gameplay elements that could be cool.

### 4:08 AM - Jo S

Checking out what kind of character would be interesting to interact with, etc, etc.

### 4:10 AM - Jo S

Visual design a bit too, to set the tone of what the interactions with the players would be (is it serious, more humor). It's not really the game part yet at that stage normally.

### 4:15 AM - Me

Okay yeh, let's start with that then - send the order and I'll get it started! Yeh visual design was something that was bugging me since I'm more of a dev than a visual guy üôè.

### 4:19 AM - Jo S

I did a lot of reference sheets for game work, I can do that too during the first order. Have some proposition of mood and visuals that could be interesting. There was a lot of nice and interesting educational games a few years back that could be nice references.

### 4:28 AM - Me

Reference sheet - is that similar to a character reference sheet but just overall for a game? But yes if it's what I'm thinking, yehh it does indeed sound interesting!

### 4:35 AM - Jo S

It's like a character sheet, but for the whole game, like the vibes, possible mechanics, the characters, etc.

### 4:36 AM - Jo S

It helps later artists and designers grasp an idea of what the game is and what you want as a whole design.

### 5:50 AM - Me

Okay yeh, that sounds like a good way to succinctly communicate this. I like the idea of that as a deliverable then other docs to explain more complex ideas or give examples etc more as needed.

### 6:50 AM - Jo S

Yes that sounds good!

### 1:26 PM - Me

Should I purchase the 165 option from your listing or am I waiting for a custom order from you lol.

### 1:26 PM - Jo S

Yes, I was about to send you a custom order!

### 1:26:01 PM - Me

Was waiting on the custom one but if it's all the same, I can do that one as well.

### 1:27 PM - Me

Ok perfect!

Delayed on getting you that info - couple meetings came up - is there a way to give you more time on an order? But yeh, will have you a packet today.

### 3:20 PM - Jo S

Yeah I can extend the deadline of the order, but I'll still have enough time to complete it. I usually give myself a couple more days than necessary on an order in case something happens!
