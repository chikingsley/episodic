# Brain Dump

00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:10,500 [Chi]
Okay, Jesus. Uh, I tried to r-record a couple of things into that Super Whisper app, and it did not w-work and it quit on me.

00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:15,199 [Chi]
But what was good about the Super Whisper app is that it had a,

00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:20,719 [Chi]
um, well, what's good about them is they have a API,

00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:31,219 [Chi]
and they have that native transcription. So anyway, I, I, I, I'm, I wanna make my own.

00:00:31,219 --> 00:00:45,919 [Chi]
Another idea.

00:00:45,919 --> 00:00:47,180 [Chi]
So the idea...

00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:52,079 [Chi]
I have so many things

00:00:52,079 --> 00:01:16,879 [Chi]
going through my head right now. I'm just,

00:01:16,879 --> 00:02:23,659 [Chi]
uh, I'm just going on a walk. Um, basically- Oh man, fuck. Okay. The idea I just had is like, okay, voice, like, we need a voice first app where the ideas... Of course, like just normal, like talk to somebody, agent, whatever. But one of the things about the app is, like theoretically you can record a voice thing and just- That's the idea. Just record a voice thing, and then you can pick an agent or one of your characters or one of the people. You can pick somebody who you want to respond to it, who you want to, you know, you want to get their perspective on it. You want them to flesh it out. You want them to turn it into a PRD. Um, you want them to do like two or three rounds on it with a couple other people, um, who maybe have your voice or maybe have something else. Uh, y-you want them to kind of fle- You wanna push it a little bit , you know? That would be the idea of it. It's like, "Hey, come up with..." You know, it's just, if you have a voice, you have a voice note. So that way you don't have your voice notes sitting in the ether. Um, you know, you have your voice notes that come up now and again. Uh, the other thing that could a-also happen with that app is that,

00:02:23,659 --> 00:02:46,919 [Chi]
uh, and this is one of the things that ReadWise was doing, is y-you have this spaced repetition of bringing things up again and then connecting things automatically. So having the ability to actually, okay, well, you had this, "Hey, you thought about this a few weeks ago. Is there any work on it?" You know, following up the spaced repetition on your notes to make sure shit just does not, does not get

00:02:46,919 --> 00:03:19,419 [Chi]
thought about and lost to the ether. So bringing back up these voice notes is important. Bringing back up these things is important. And then, of course, you know, ultimately like getting tasks together and, um, knocking things down. So, it's like there's, there's levels to it, but one of the first ones would be, yeah, hey, just making a voice note. Cool. And then voice memo, cool. And then, but the fact that it doesn't just sit there, something can happen to it. Or if you make a note on something,

00:03:19,419 --> 00:03:21,519 [Chi]
something can happen to it.

00:03:21,519 --> 00:04:27,739 [Chi]
There's something that always happens to me where it's like, hey, you know, I'm in the club or I'm out and I, I don't have the... You don't have the time, or you don't even have the desire or the time to sit down and actually like talk with somebody or do anything. I just wanna record a quick thing about what's happening in the night, and the agent, you know, the person, whoever can look at it after it's done. You know, and they can process it or they can do whatever they want, whether it's like, uh, whether it's a field note, because sometimes I'm taking notes on the night, like what's going on. So it's just a, a memo like here, this is what's going on. Of course, we have the actual memo, but then we actually also get a transcript. So we don't lose the transcript. And that's one of the things that was happening whenever I record something into Claude or OpenAI, you lose the actual transcription. You lose the energy, you lose the passion, you lose the, the whatever you had when you were actually recording it, and that's... Like you have the transcript, but what's the value of the transcript when you don't have... You can't reprocess all that shit again. You can't, you know, one day

00:04:27,739 --> 00:05:19,559 [Chi]
dump all of that and have, have all of that, that, that... You know, when we are, whenever we have true multimodal, uh, we are, you know, you're not gonna be able to dump that into a context and build on some energy. So this is also something where it's like you have this data and, and you're building on it yourself, um, so you can assign it to people and so on. So it's a true thing of, uh, recording stuff in the moment and having it, uh, you know, and having it be processed into a project or, you know, it's, there's a lot of, there's a lot of ways that you could, uh, kind of do this, but that's that idea. Okay. The other thing, okay, and this is the main reason I started today, was because I had a lot of ideas with regards to, um, people that need to be hired and how to be more effective myself.

00:05:19,559 --> 00:05:28,199 [Chi]
I have so many weaknesses, but I think my biggest weakness is that I just do too much. Too, I have too many ideas,

00:05:28,199 --> 00:06:57,861 [Chi]
and I want to touch too many things. Pause. I just wanna do too much. You know, today I had the idea of, okay, and I was using Super Whisper and, and I've, and I got into Super Whisper automa- uh, automation. And honestly, I even like kind of fucked it up a little bit with Hammerspoon, and like I, I'm not even using the automation at this point because my idea was too big. But I was like, you know, I came up with the... You know, it's like o- once you have these couple automations, how far are you away from... Because Super Whisper at this point for me, Super Whisper's free. Super Whisper is free, and technically, by the way, I mean, technically, if you just get Whisper CPP on your thing, then-Whisper.cpp. Of course, then the transcription's free anyway, and it's super fast and it's great. But theoretically, with, uh, with their se- with their setup, I also have a free API. So I can send stuff to Claude and theoretically, then I can, I, I can get a free API basically to have a free, um, uh, voice agent on my, on my desktop. I paid $250 for the, for the full, full version, lifetime. And so, I have the... I have a free API on my desktop that is unused right now. So it's interesting, 'cause I spend, I spend way more than that on, on Claude. You know, are you out of your damn mind? I spend $250 in, in a week on Claude. So I'm like, "Dude, you telling me I can get a free API on this?" That's very interesting. So

00:06:57,861 --> 00:07:10,441 [Chi]
it's like, how can we take advantage of the, of a free fucking API? Like how can you get, take advantage of free Claude? So that's the one thing. And then, and then if you're talking about... Okay, and then I thought, was thinking, well, uh,

00:07:10,441 --> 00:08:08,381 [Chi]
so then we started thinking about a voice assistant. And then I was thinking about, well, I want Scar from 1994 Lion King to be my voice assistant. Shout out to, uh, oh, don't... Jeremy Irons. And so then I went to find that movie, and I downloaded it because I didn't have it, and then I went through and, uh, put that movie into CapCut and then cut all the parts where Jeremy Irons was, uh, Scar and, and talking. And I probably got up to, nah, wasn't... It was probably 10 minutes, I... It wasn't a long... It was pretty decent size. It was decent size. It was up to 30 minutes maybe. I don't know. Um, no, it was probably 10 minutes. Probably around 10 minutes. Kind of... And, and then, uh, then I cle- I had to clean that. That took a long time, by the way. That took a long time. And then clean the audio and then try to clone it. Um, but then, you, you know, did a bunch of shit. Anyway, and I got some good outputs. Shout out to Play HT. Play HT is fire. And then it had me in the i- the idea of, wait a minute, what if you could just do this

00:08:08,381 --> 00:09:14,741 [Chi]
with vi- with movies? You know, I've seen these, uh, editors that people have where they do, oh, we have Cursor for video editing. And I've seen these things where they basically have this, and then so it's like, wait, what? If you just... It would be awesome if you just throw a movie into a, a thing and have it automatically pull all the different characters, you know, in order of, like, the frequency. And then you could see all the characters that are available to, you know, to clone or to do something with. And then it would be cool to then, you know, it's like you could pick the characters that you want, and so you look at all their scenes. You kind of edit the audios just to make sure like in and outs are good, and maybe you can cut some stuff and maybe you can perfect it a little bit. Take out some silences, I don't know, you know, and just have some, you know, really nice audio. And then, uh, and then, you know, from there, uh, pu- push it into a, a cleaning thing, you know, which either that's an API or whatever, and then you get that output, and then boom. Then you clone it, and then you're able to use it immediately in a voice assistant. That would be sick.

00:09:14,741 --> 00:09:22,261 [Chi]
You know, all on device or using an API. That would be sick.

00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:59,721 [Chi]
So I thought that would be interesting. That would... So that's what I spent, like, the last 24 hours on, was that idea, 'cause that spawned... 'Cause yeah, so we had like... You see, like the way that ideas, like, come all the way down. And then I just had that idea right now with the, with this. But based on, like, my struggle, based on this thing, like stopping. Of course I have this voice me- this voice memo here, but I'm gonna have to put... I'm gonna have to, like, send this voice memo to myself and then transcribe it, and it's just gonna be, like three things. And it's like, I could- it could have been something else. Could have been smaller, could have been more interesting.

00:09:59,721 --> 00:10:01,701 [Chi]
Okay.

00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:34,841 [Chi]
So anyway, so I have a lot of weaknesses. So 'cause these things come up. Um, I have a, you know, if I just go through ideas of projects that I potentially have that... I was working on this tailor app, um, makes a couple of dollars. It's not a super, super, super valuable thing, but it's like, you know, to manage your measurements or to manage your client's measurements, dude. It was fucking... It was annoying. Um, there was an app that, that was doing it, but they started charging money, and it's like, why? It, it's such a simple app. Now, of course, I already remade it, but then while I was there, I was like, "Well,

00:10:34,841 --> 00:10:43,941 [Chi]
well, why don't we actually just add this other shit?" Which is a mistake, by the way. So in the end, what do I think? I think I should go back to that app,

00:10:43,941 --> 00:10:49,061 [Chi]
make that exact version, okay, that I liked,

00:10:49,061 --> 00:11:01,881 [Chi]
uh, with the improved pictures and everything, with the improved SVGs, publish it, and then add the improvements that I wanted to add later with, with the actual project management, 'cause we were adding an extra project management and, and scope management and all that stuff.

00:11:01,881 --> 00:11:17,241 [Chi]
You know, with a, you know, somebody will be able to actually ma- m- m- you know, add projects to a person. They can monitor their own measurements and do all this shit. It could be a cool wh- whole, whole thing, but you know. So I had a tailor app idea. Of course, um,

00:11:17,241 --> 00:12:02,561 [Chi]
do that, do that. There's also the whole thing about tech packs. You know, modifying, making a tech pack is kind of a bitch. And there's a couple softwares for it, but they're not perfect, and, and, and, and a lot of them, the good ones, they cost money. And who has money? And, and of course there's CLO3D, and CLO3D is god, but you know, is there, is there a world where, you know, you just need to, you know, you have your outputs, you have everything, it's just that you need a couple of thing, you know, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. You need the seams and it's like you need a simple version and you want the AI, and, and possibly even an AI breakdown of, of the clothing with different views, um, automatically and pitching seams is like so much potential now, especially with the image editors that we have, you know.

00:12:02,561 --> 00:12:06,501 [Chi]
Like breaking down a clothing item,

00:12:06,501 --> 00:13:52,179 [Chi]
bringing together the seams that would be necessary to cli- to, to create it, and then actually just create, you know, theoretically with AI creating a, um...... a tech pack. You know, and then sending that to somebody. That's, that should be... It's pos- There's no reason it's not possible, especially if you put together a template, there's no reason it's not possible. So especially if you have, like, it's, like, things that people wanna make typically, and then maybe some atypical things, you know. It's possible. So that's another. It's like two projects in one. It could be, could be the same project, but it's probably two. Tailor app and then probably, like, you know, tech pack creator thing. That's a, that's another one. Um, we have the construction co-pilot, which people say, uh, the homie was talking about, just talk to your projects. Literally, just talk to your projects, be able to hook up your thing to your project with SharePoint or Google or wherever your project is. All the documents, be able to just hook up to that source and talk to that project. What's going on? What's the status update? What needs to happen, you know? And that'd be like, just a very basic, be able to talk to it, and then you can add stuff on top of it potentially where, you know, maybe you can really hook in and actually edit things. I don't know. But top level, just be able to talk to it. Which to me, honestly, we could probably get that done in, like, half a day. Just get a couple APIs, get permissions, should be good. So that's another project. But somebody needs to just... Still, still, even though it's like, oh, that's an easy project, somebody needs to do it. Let's sit down, get in Cursor, fucking do it. Or get in, uh, Bolt.new, fucking do it, right? It's not... It's easy. Or, or just code it up. That's not a fucking hard project. It probably already exists. You probably just clone some open source shit and set it up and white label it. You could probably do that, you know?

00:13:52,179 --> 00:14:15,159 [Chi]
So it's that. I mean, of course, we have the therapy AI thing. It's this voice assistant on your phone, talk to you about your feelings, all that shit. Um, similar idea with the voice thing that I just talked about, you know? It's a similar genre. Uh, of course, we just have, you know, like, the, you know, and of course the, with the voice agent and... Yeah, all those, there's like three voice agent ideas. I guess we can kind of synthesize those three. Uh,

00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:17,699 [Chi]
we had the idea of...

00:14:17,699 --> 00:14:23,299 [Chi]
Oh, there was an idea where it was like, with your physical...

00:14:23,299 --> 00:16:10,859 [Chi]
You know, you walk around all day, we count your steps and all this shit. It's like, I had this idea of gamifying, you know, similar to Strava, but S-T-R-A-V-A, like, similar to Strava, but like gamifying finance, right? Like your finances. How much money you have in the bank account and saving, you know? And playing with that, you know, and, and having people be able to brag about what they do and do not spend money on, and, you know, have people be able to, like... A- and then, like, you even, you even get, like, a- achievements or points if you, if you have streaks for... If you can keep up your streak. You know, even, this is a crazy concept, can you imagine gamifying a finance app where, like, you can have streaks for having all of your purchases, um, categorized, you know? And having everything actually categorized and knowing everything that's coming in and out of your bank account. And having perfectly, you know, uh, what's it, what's that thing called? You know, if you have everything recurring and you understand everything going into and out of your bank account, you get a streak. You get the streak for the day. You know, so you're like gamify it. You force people to get in and out of that bitch. And then, of course, you know, maybe if they, if they get in and out of that, they get free Chipotle in a month. You know what I mean? Like, I don't know what the incentive would be, but that's a great... Dude, why, h- how did I come up with that idea just now? That's fucking stupid, bro. That's fucking crazy idea. Gamify that shit. You know, get people, 'cause tha- 'cause, you know, that process of fucking, you know, and then, and then, you know, and then you b- you throw them like, "Hey, man, if you go back historically and clean up your entire bank account history and get to categorizing everything, which y- we have, we have AI will help you out, you know? And, and if you need help to, like, go through emails, try to match some stuff up, we can help." It's like, give us access to all the emails. Uh, you know, and it's like

00:16:10,859 --> 00:16:19,419 [Chi]
partially probably a data play. You know, i- it's some understanding. I don't know what the, uh, place to monetize that would be. We would have to talk to the streets about it, but

00:16:19,419 --> 00:16:40,759 [Chi]
crazy play. And then you could, uh, you could buy them out. Each, 500 bucks, 300 bucks if you clean up your entire history. You know? You know? And then, you know, of course we can help, um, you know, with the AI agents, we can help you cancel some of that shit that's been sitting there.

00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:44,319 [Chi]
That's a crazy idea, man.

00:16:44,319 --> 00:16:47,059 [Chi]
So,

00:16:47,059 --> 00:16:49,139 [Chi]
so what?

00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:59,939 [Chi]
Um, of course, this is general content. Uh, yeah, and then, then, then we have my language learning app, which is just... I have like 30 fucking game ideas in this bitch, dude. Like, just so many.

00:16:59,939 --> 00:17:47,519 [Chi]
So fucking many, bro. So fucking many. I just, there's like four game... I don't even know what... I don't even know if I wanna go through the l- language learning apps, 'cause I've just gone through too many times. You know, there's just so, so, so many contextual... You know, we have an explicit game. It's just a game. I don't know. And then we have... But Pimsleur, like, we have audio first lessons where purely... Like, let's say this is an app, audio first lessons. Hey, you're gonna go out to the street and meet a new girl, or you're gonna meet somebody from a dating app and you don't know anything. And it's like, "What do you know? Do you know anything? Do you know how to say any of these words?" You, if you say, "I know nothing," cool. We throw you in the fire. If you know a couple things, then we add some stuff, you know? So it's like...

00:17:47,519 --> 00:20:26,301 [Chi]
And maybe we start talking with an agent already. It's like, "What do you know? Do you know how to say 'I am'? Do you know how to..." You just, like, get into the cut with an agent from jump. And then we can use something like Pipecat Flows plus the new conversational AI that ElevenLabs has and really fucking steer somebody. 'Cause the AI agent theoretically is, has the full ability to do that whole motherfucker, which would be super, super interesting.That's the, that's a cool, really cool idea. It's like, what do you know? You know this, you know this, you know this. Okay. So, here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna run through it. All right, so, uh, we're, you're, what you're gonna do... Ah, can you imagine, dude? Can you fucking imagine? 'Cause, uh, 11 Labs 2.0 just released today. Can you fucking imagine a live fucking conversation where two... Like, just a Pimsleur live with two fucking people right there. Three people right there. A narrative that... A narrator that's literally talking to you, to you specifically. And then we have a, uh, I don't know how we're d- running the pronunciation API or the fuck it. I don't know how we're doing that and checking the pronunciation so that, you know, we can really make sure that you're getting the, you're getting the, uh, the, the attention specifically that you need. But it's like, fucking live. We're taking the interactivity, the adaptivity that Duolingo has, that some of these people have, and we're bringing it into local. We're taking the idea of Pimsleur and the idea of these interactive audio first lessons, and we're bringing it into 2025, 2026, into the modern era of AI agents and AI shit. So, no longer, no longer, "Oh, I'm just gonna listen to..." No, I'm listening for when you speak. And if you don't get it, then I'll say, "Okay, yeah, this is the word. I wanna hear you say it now. Yeah, okay. Say it again. Okay. No, your accent's a little bit off there. S- one more time, just a little..." Uh, the noise is gonna be more in the back of your mouth. Can you fucking imagine that? Nah, the noise is gonna be more in the back of your throat. You wanna... Uh, this is the advice. It, it sounds like you're doing this. Do this. Ooh, can you imagine that accent trainer talking to you, motherfu- Goddamn. Goddamn. And then you have a fucking... And then, of course, yeah, and then you just, you just... People are modeling the conversation. So, you just have this real l- time interactive thing that... Yeah, it's like, that's a language. That's a, that's a fucking killer thing right there. It's not even a fucking game, but it's like real. It's a fucking real. You take the bullshit that everybody's doing, you just replace it with some good shit. It's just off top.

00:20:26,301 --> 00:21:02,441 [Chi]
And then, of course, there's a whole thing about like just generating shows and then having them kind of learn the basic stuff through the show. I mean, there's like generating the TV show or the, in, almost an interactive. I mean, we have the visual novel, but it's like generating stuff and have them, t- having them learn Pimsleur style through the show. And then there's something like, like the visual novel, which like, eh, more of an interrogation style. You're going back and forth, visual novel kinda vibe style, eh, with that. And then there's like, getting into kind of a platformer where you get into a Chants of Sennaar. You get into a, um, a Heavens Vault. Uh, you get into, um...

00:21:02,441 --> 00:22:31,701 [Chi]
Whoo, uh, uh, Genshin Impact t- uh, type of shit, where we're walking around the world and we're talking. But we're talking and we're saying real shit, and you're doing real shit in the real world. And we act- and we bring in all the fucking elements from everything else. W- a real fucking game where you're doing real fucking shit. Go through the world and... Hey, go run after that girl. Get her attention now. She can hear you. She can hear you. Go get that guy's attention in the fucking café, bruv, and we'll tell you what to say. Tell him hello. All right, now he's listening. I'm in your ear. Like, you got the, you got the AirPod in. Okay. Yeah, tell him, uh, tell him... Ask him his name. Oh, that's cool. U- tell him, uh... Man, come on. Come on. Fucking crazy idea, dude. So, and then after, and that's just... Do I have anything else on my side? Just from my side? And of course, it's just content, man. I am a content fucking machine. I can think of shit all the time. Just even the way that I just came up with these fucking thoughts. Just came up with these fucking ideas off top, dude. Just came up with these fucking things. And I'm not even... It's just like, this shit just like, once you get rolling, it just starts coming to you. The Lord is with me. Thy shall not want. He maketh me lie down in green pastures. He restoreth me inside still waters. He restoreth my soul. He leadeth me beside the path of pure righteousness. He restor- I walketh through the valley...

00:22:31,701 --> 00:22:39,021 [Chi]
Uh, shadow of death. I shall feel no evil. By the way, I wanna, I wanna, I did wanna re- um,

00:22:39,021 --> 00:22:45,881 [Chi]
I did wa- want to memorize, um... This truly is my favorite fucking

00:22:45,881 --> 00:22:54,061 [Chi]
book of the Bible, or the chapter. I don't... It's one... It's First John Three. I love this shit.

00:22:54,061 --> 00:22:56,701 [Chi]
And you know why I love it? 'Cause it...

00:22:56,701 --> 00:23:00,741 [Chi]
I love it for several reasons. I love it for reasons that

00:23:00,741 --> 00:23:03,081 [Chi]
I think...

00:23:03,081 --> 00:23:05,901 [Chi]
Well,

00:23:05,901 --> 00:23:16,781 [Chi]
I don't love it for like, the reasons that pe- I love it for, you know... Well, at first, u- I love... Originally, it, I- I was correct. Okay? Made me correct. But I think...

00:23:16,781 --> 00:23:29,821 [Chi]
Which one is it? It's the NS... I'm looking for the NSR... Yeah.

00:23:29,821 --> 00:23:33,161 [Chi]
Okay.

00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:56,961 [Chi]
So, this is the NS... The NRVU- NRSVUE. This is the version that I think that everybody says is the scholar version that everybody agrees on, or it's like, the closest thing to scholar a- agreements, whatever. See, the... See what the love the Father has given us, that we should not be called children of God,

00:23:56,961 --> 00:24:01,201 [Chi]
and that is what we are.

00:24:01,201 --> 00:24:07,561 [Chi]
The reason that the world does not know us is that it does not know him. First of all, that's fucking bars, bruh.

00:24:07,561 --> 00:24:38,016 [Chi]
You don't know me 'cause you don't know him. If you knew him, you'd know me. I mean, like, the kind of bars, I don't know. Beloved, we are God's children now. What we will be has not yet been revealed. Ooh.Come on, man. That's what I'm saying, people don't know me yet. And they know me, but they don't know me. You don't know what we doing. What we do know is that, what we do know is this, "When He is revealed, we will be like Him, for we will s- all see Him as He is.

00:24:38,016 --> 00:24:45,436 [Chi]
And all those who have hope in Him purify themselves because He is pure, just as He is pure.

00:24:45,436 --> 00:25:04,055 [Chi]
And all those who, uh, and all those who have the, hope in Him purify themselves just as He is pure." Which is a, an, an interesting interpretation. The way that the other one was saying, it's like, those do not sin. But this is saying, no, people righteously, proactively purify themselves

00:25:04,055 --> 00:25:57,115 [Chi]
because they have this hope. "Everyone who commits sin is guilty of lawlessness. Sin is lawlessness. You know that He was revealed to take away sins, and in Him, there is no sin. No one who abides in Him sins. No one who sins has either seen Him or known Him." Which is ...side of man. "Little children, let no one deceive you. Everyone who does what is right is righteous just as He is righteous. Everyone who commits sin is of the devil for the devil has been sinning since the beginning. The Son of God was revealed for this purpose, to destroy th- the works of the devil. Those who have been born of God do not sin because God abides in them. They cannot sin because they have been born of God. The children of God and the children of the devil are revealed in this way. All who do not do what is right are not from God, nor are they,

00:25:57,115 --> 00:25:59,395 [Chi]
nor are they those who

00:25:59,395 --> 00:26:12,895 [Chi]
do not love a brother or sister." "All who do not do what is right are not from God, nor are those who do not love a brother or sister." Damn, so if you don't love your brother or sister, you're not

00:26:12,895 --> 00:26:19,915 [Chi]
real. And if you don't know God then, yeah ... you sin. So, but, listen, I'm not religious but

00:26:19,915 --> 00:26:29,495 [Chi]
to me, w- w- when I read this, part... Uh, I gave the example, I was trying, I was talking to a guy y- the other, yesterday, and I think he, he's, um,

00:26:29,495 --> 00:26:40,035 [Chi]
he's in, he's in his, uh, world, right? As a religious person, and that's fine. Uh, living his best life, I'm happy for him. But my perspective on it was then,

00:26:40,035 --> 00:27:37,055 [Chi]
I, in my life, I would've never stayed home on a Saturday night. You could have never told me at any point in my life, you could have never convinced me logically to stay home at any point in my life 'cause why the fuck would I stay in the house? The, the, the, you know, I had, maybe I stayed in, I stayed, uh, ye- y- stayed, uh, didn't go out on a Friday or a Saturday night. The only reason I wouldn't go on a, out on a Friday or a Saturday night was because I was, like, uh, forced by the, by circumstance. Like, I had to get something done or I would physically fail, like, out of a class because I, I would fail a test. Like, if I did not have the absolute stakes or the absolute, you have to get this homework done, then I was gonna go out and I was gonna be chasing pussy, 'cause that's what the fuck I was doing. That's what I enjoyed doing and that's, and to do, even today I do enjoy those things. The only, the thing

00:27:37,055 --> 00:28:08,235 [Chi]
that finally brought me back in was, first of all, ha- doing that shit for so fucking long and then having the, getting a little bit older, fe- uh, seeing children out and about. A- and then even having a thing that I genuinely have passion and enjoyment of that's bigger than fucking, of another vagina. And also, I think masturbating helps as well. I masturbate, uh, you know, a couple of times, maybe once a day, a couple of times, and that helps a lot. It just takes the edge off. But like,

00:28:08,235 --> 00:28:39,435 [Chi]
I used to masturbate too back in the day, but it's like, listen. You know what I mean? Like, you could have ne- I, I, I haven't had s-, uh, I haven't had sex in like a few weeks now, and that's, I'm, like, I love, and it's fine. Dude, past me would've b- bought a ticket to Lithuania and we would've, be trying to fuck that girl 'cause she's calling me attractive. You know? I would've been do, done that, but I didn't. I'm, I'm in here busting it, that, like, fucking thinking about all this bullshit 'cause it's different. So,

00:28:39,435 --> 00:28:44,855 [Chi]
when I say, so, I guess when,

00:28:44,855 --> 00:30:43,329 [Chi]
uh, when I hear the, this verse, to me, what it means to me is, like, if you, if you are about some shit, then you're about it. And if you are not about it, then you're not about it. There's this thing that Andrew Tate used to say, it's like, "Man, i- people complain about money, but then you are out buying beer, and you're out, like, you're, you're out and your, your bank account's not been analyzed. You don't know what you're spending money on. You don't know what the recurring purchases are in your fucking Apple account. You don't know, you haven't thought of, uh, any business ideas. You haven't tried to solve anybody's problems. You haven't even tried to solve your own fucking problems. You are out here, uh, you know, uh, you haven't tried, you haven't done any s- education." It's like, what, uh, or you want, you want a girlfriend, and you've never... You don't go out, you, you haven't gotten coaching, you haven't bought a, bought a course, you haven't watched any content, you haven't tried to go up and talk to any girls. You haven't, uh, gone to the fucking church even and fucking asked the counselor, even somebody who doesn't fucking know shit, but at least do something. You haven't done... So at what level are we saying that you don't like being poor or you don't like not having a girlfriend? At what level can you even make those statements when you do nothing to fucking better or, or give a, show that you give a fuck about this shit at all? And to me, that's similar, you know, when Jesus says something like, you know, some, a lot of people, they gonna show up here and I'm gonna say, "I don't know you, bro. I don't know you 'cause you're just paying lip service to an idea." You're paying lip service to a vibe, to some shit in the world that makes you feel good in a certain moment. And so you say it and then, but by any other moment, t-T- t- if it's inconvenient or if it's whatever in your life, y- you fucking do something else. And that is sinful. To me, not living... Eh, that's... Patrice O'Neal

00:30:43,329 --> 00:32:37,589 [Chi]
said this and I, and I, and it's... H- he tried to explain it few times and I... I don't, I- I don't wanna butcher it, but he said, "Listen, I don't care what you do but just live righteously." And that does not mean religion. Live righteously. Don't lie to yourself. Lying to yourself is the sin. If you like to fuck lady boys, then by definition you li- you are fucking guys. You are fucking people with penises. And that will make... That makes you gay. And don't lie. And that's how fine, that's fine. It's like literally fine. By the way, like even for me, uh, I li-... Listen, I like a little bit of trans porn here and there. I don't think I'd ever fuck one, but maybe. I'd fuck a trans girl probably. Uh, it does not make me gay probably. I's- I'm probably bisexual. Hey, listen, it is the first time I've said that out loud but it is... Hey, listen, am I probably gay, a little bit bisexual? Yeah! Yeah. But that... Yeah. But am I like gay? Uh, yes, but what, uh... But bi- bisexual, bi-sex... And... But do I like guys like that? Nah, bruh. Like I'm not outside like, "Yeah, like I- I know a guy, a good-looking guy," when I see. I know all that shit. But I like the girl version. That make any sense? I like the, the titty, the titties and the ass on a hot bitch that happens to have a dick. Not... To me, that's still gay. It is. But, and but the... But, but having that nuance but underst-... But saying that still and own it. Listen, it's not about... You can be gay, just... But l- that's part of righteousness to me. That's part of the righteousness is not lying to yourself. This is the case. And by the way, like,

00:32:37,589 --> 00:33:12,189 [Chi]
by definition of, of a lot of shit, I'm a misogynist sometimes. I do hate women sometimes. Sometimes girls interact with me and I don't like them. Would I say I'm a holistic... Would I, would I say I'm like a, a misogynist on a level of, like, I hate all women? Absolu- fuck no, dude. It's literally specific people, specific girls at specific times. And sometimes that specific girl, that hatred will kind of... It will expand to include a, a group level 'cause I just... That person affected me at that level in that moment. But is it... You know what I mean? But that's... Hey, but the honesty.

00:33:12,189 --> 00:33:30,509 [Chi]
Listen, you could lie to the people, but don't lie to yourself. And that's part of the thing. Don't lie to yourself. For me, that's why I struggle with a lot 'cause... And there's... 'Cause there's two sides to everything as well. There's two sides. 'Cause there's, there's, there's not lying to self and then there's also

00:33:30,509 --> 00:33:34,249 [Chi]
there's also believing in something

00:33:34,249 --> 00:33:35,909 [Chi]
which is

00:33:35,909 --> 00:34:49,629 [Chi]
l- beli-... And that is mm-mm, man. There's believing in something. There's believing that whatever is in front of you is not the only thing that's in front of you. It's believing that the thing that you're seeing in front of your eyes isn't just the thing that you're seeing in front of your fucking eyes. And it's understanding that you are putting by default... There is no objective. By default you are putting layers of meaning on top of everything that you see in front of you. And that is... And, and you get to choose those layers of meaning that you... Oh man, what am I doing? Why am I spitting like this? Ah, whoa, what the hell? You get to choose the layers of meaning that you are placing on top of everything. And by default, let me tell you that you are placing layers of meaning on top of the things. And one of those... By the way, as a atheist, as a personal, as a nihilist, some of the... I- i- it may be stripped away, but even those things of life doesn't have a purpose or... Th- that is a choice. And whether or not you... Eh, well, it's subjective. It's... All right, listen.

00:34:49,629 --> 00:36:00,689 [Chi]
There is a one... And by the way, there is a fucking level where like we all die tomorrow and whatever, but at the end of the day you still get to choose how you interact with the world. If you want your entire fucking world to be the children that you had... Eh, that you have in your life, then that is your world. If you want your whole world, if you want... If you want 50% of your world to be the kids, 20% to be new pussy, 10% to be old pussy, and, and tw- 20% to be the job, that's the choice that you fucking... That is the layers, that's the layers of meaning that you put on the world. And you could say, "Oh, it means nothing," but it means something to you because you wake up every day and you didn't jump off the fucking roof that day. So there's gotta, there's something. And to the credit of the Christians, "Hey, there's something you are worshiping." Fuck that language. They know what the fuck they're doing with that bullshit ass language. Ain't nobody worshiping shit, but what people are doing... By the way, shout out to Jordan Peterson. No one's worshiping shit. If you wanna redefine words to mean some shit that nobody fucking means whenever they're talking, then by all means have at it, go do, do your fucking worst.

00:36:00,689 --> 00:36:25,129 [Chi]
In the Bible, if you wanna talk about it like that, if you wanna talk about it, there are things that you choose to prioritize and to think about and to focus on in your life. And that is an... All of that is a choice. There, there's a concept... Oh, don't let me, don't let me forget. Don't let me forget

00:36:25,129 --> 00:36:27,569 [Chi]
your, um,

00:36:27,569 --> 00:36:44,691 [Chi]
reticular activation system. Ooh, mm-mm.... particular activation system plus the cognitive bias. It's the shit that you are focused on for whatever reason, positive or negative. These are the things that, uh,

00:36:44,691 --> 00:37:32,631 [Chi]
s- more things will manifest to you in, in th-, in, in the, in the world that you live in, positive or negative, based on the beliefs that you have about the world. If you... And I tell people all the time, if you truly, and this is truly, this is truly, it's not just speak, and take a talk, a lip service to it. And by the way, it's not fucking easy, right? Charles- Jocko Willink, right? He lived that shit maybe, but he said some, he said some crazy shit one time. He said he got... I think he got it from the army or something. He said, "The only failure is if you die." And the death, it's only failure 'cause you can't do nothing else 'cause there's no existence of anything, uh, uh... Uh, he said, he said it a little bit better. I'm not... Let's, let's leave that over there.

00:37:32,631 --> 00:37:35,171 [Chi]
The point is,

00:37:35,171 --> 00:37:36,991 [Chi]
there's...

00:37:36,991 --> 00:37:42,291 [Chi]
There is layers upon layers of everything, and, and I- I truly, you know, uh,

00:37:42,291 --> 00:37:56,531 [Chi]
you know, I, as I get older, I realize some things like that. And so it's very strange. I realize that, you know, a lot of time, if I'm talking crazy, if I'm talking wild, then it's like, I am choosing

00:37:56,531 --> 00:37:59,171 [Chi]
to have this belief about

00:37:59,171 --> 00:39:29,751 [Chi]
something. Uh, that's not, uh, the right way to say the thing that I want to say 'cause I don't... Belief is not a choice in a way, but I will say that looking at things through the frame that I'm looking at, to an ex-, uh, I have a, I have a ch-... No, to be honest. No, you do choose your beliefs too. I think you do choose your beliefs. There's not like... I'm, I ca- You can't choose to believe like the world is upside down or, uh, and, and things are right side up. But you can... You have control over a lot of your beliefs, if not all of your beliefs, to, to an extent. And tru- 'cause truly, if you live, if you live, like, uh, you go out and you're like, "Hey, every girl loves me. Every girl fucking is super attracted to me." It's fucking crazy. And the ones who reject me or they act a little bit weird, uh, they're just, you know, they're under a spell, and they'll, they'll come around. But, you know, and, but, but, you know, one of the things I can do to lessen that spell is to learn social dynamic. Like, you could reframe the whole fucking shit so that it's a fucking game, and it's not a f-... You can reframe, and that's a choice. You can do that. And then you can redefine the evidence in front of you to be part, to be fucking A. If 20 people reject me today, I get to go get ice cream. You can redefine that shit if you... Even if I'm fucking, if I make $0 today, I'll fucking masturbate. And if I make $20, then I'll... You know what I mean? It's, I don't know how to... You know what I mean? You can redefine this shit. Anyway, okay.

00:39:29,751 --> 00:39:32,171 [Chi]
I say all that to say,

00:39:32,171 --> 00:39:40,751 [Chi]
I say all that to say everything. Uh, I have a lot of energy. I have a lot of shit to say, obvi- obviously, as you can see.

00:39:40,751 --> 00:39:43,171 [Chi]
You know? But I don't have

00:39:43,171 --> 00:40:36,971 [Chi]
enough time in the day to devote to saying all the things that I want to say and to doing all the things that I want to do. I have too many ideas, and shit just flows. There are, there is a new agent, there's a new idea, there's a new vibe, there's a new piece of content, there's a new thing every fucking hour, every fucking day. And the extent to which I don't start delegating things is the extent to which we start fucking losing. All right? Or we are losing. I don't know. It's, it's the extent to which is just, um, it's just stuff that doesn't happen in, in our, in my life, you know? And it's... I would like more things to happen. I love the fucking idea of preaching. I should be a preaching. I should be preaching. I should be preaching that Jordan Peterson shit. I should be preaching the goddamn truth in the Bible, or the, what I, you know, what I consider the truth of the Bible, you know?

00:40:36,971 --> 00:40:39,711 [Chi]
Bring heaven on earth.

00:40:39,711 --> 00:40:44,251 [Chi]
And if you... Listen, and this... Is this shit literally true?

00:40:44,251 --> 00:40:45,891 [Chi]
No.

00:40:45,891 --> 00:40:55,831 [Chi]
And yes. But did somebody... You know, I'll be the first to say, did somebody walk across, done walk on water 2000 years ago?

00:40:55,831 --> 00:41:10,951 [Chi]
I'll say probably not, but that's not the point. That's not the point of the story. And if you mistake... Uh, the, if you think that that's the point of the story, you're missing out on a lot of the shit of the book.

00:41:10,951 --> 00:41:27,931 [Chi]
You know? Because truly hav-... 'Cause to me, one of the... The, the thing about having... The thing about the Bible, the thing about something is the way that it's worded, the way that it's done, the way that it's... And you could do it with somebody else's words, by the way. It's just, you know, with some... I don't... There's something about when something's

00:41:27,931 --> 00:43:44,969 [Chi]
this place like that. It's a different fucking... Some other shit. You know? Some other shit. Billion fucking years ago. And people still d- to pull value, to pull... It's just a different... It's a different thing to just have a relig- to have a belief like that and to, and to have s- and to pull something from down there. It's a different thing to pull something from down there. Does that make any... It's just... An- and, and probably there's a way to word that, but there's a differ- it's a, just a different vibe to pull something from ove- from, from down there versus from Jocko willing. Shout out to Jocko. Shout out to, shout out to fuckin', uh, Alex Hormozi. But it's a different thing to say, like to s- to have Jesus, to have, uh, uh, you know, allegedly John in the motherfucker seeing, you know, uh, in the context. I mean, you could... Um, I give, I give examples for other p- media all the time. But to see John in a motherfucker seeing people get turned away by people who have the visage.... of belief, who have the visage of, uh, not sin, who have the visage of doing the right thing and... but who really on their... and, and on the... on some real shit, aren't doing the right shit and truly don't believe the shit that they're, uh, that they're putting out, as the analogy goes. They're not living righteously, but they have the appearance, and so they lead other people astray. And so to come out and... to come out with some balls in your hand and say, "Hey, nah, if you was with us, you wouldn't do that." That's it. Now, is one of us falling astray from time to time? Yes. But if you was one of us, you would fight for your fucking soul to never do that shit, 'cause we don't do that shit, 'cause we know the truth and we have that truth within us, and we know Him. And the reason why you are not like us is because you don't know Him. And you don't know us because you don't know Him. And you don't know Him because you don't know us. And that... Ooh,

00:43:44,969 --> 00:43:47,489 [Chi]
man.

00:43:47,489 --> 00:43:56,469 [Chi]
Let me... Let me get my pot and pan and cook. All right. What else? What else? Um,

00:43:56,469 --> 00:43:58,749 [Chi]
so we need to hire people.

00:43:58,749 --> 00:44:02,189 [Chi]
We need to hire people. Uh,

00:44:02,189 --> 00:45:47,369 [Chi]
the biggest... The, the business that is, uh, a lot... the most potential, uh, and... but not even the most potential, it's really helping people, and I truly... to be honest, um, since I'm coming out of this thing where, you know, working for a scam, a business to an extent, you know, it's, it's... it is what it is, and, you know, I, I got under... I got... you know, just go own up to that, and, and it is... you know, it's... that's life, and, you know, we got payback society, and try to give back a little bit and do our best. You know, maybe... and it's possible, the old homie that is part of that business, maybe we could, uh, get him to contribute some of his money to this side of the business and make him some money over here, and maybe we can start to give back a little bit. Of course, you can never undo... you can never really pay penance for the, the things that you did in the past. You can never. But what you can do is be a better person today and bring heaven to earth. And that is fucking... Dude, holy shit. That's the fucking message of the fucking Bible, man. All have sinned and come short of the glory of God. You can't ne- You can never... You can never be perfect. There's no perfection. You can never... Uh, you can never fucking undo that shit, that hurt that you put on that person that while ago, or that one time you lied, or that one time you fucked up, that one time you did some, uh, shiesty, devilish, uh, the bullshit-ass shit, or you even did some things on accident. Uh, like, there's... You hurt somebody's feeling, you hurt your mom's feelings. There's nothing you could ever do to undo that, truly. Can't. Can't, can't, can't. But what you can do

00:45:47,369 --> 00:45:49,629 [Chi]
is you can

00:45:49,629 --> 00:45:56,089 [Chi]
accept the world as it is, and you can leave... You can understand,

00:45:56,089 --> 00:45:58,549 [Chi]
you can know Him,

00:45:58,549 --> 00:46:02,749 [Chi]
which, as an analogy, is you can know

00:46:02,749 --> 00:46:26,789 [Chi]
the truth, and you can know the righteousness, and you can know the situation that happened. You can know the right way, according to your beliefs, to live, and then you can live righteously from that moment, and that is your choice, and that is your cross to bear. And it is not easy sometimes. It is not easy.

00:46:26,789 --> 00:48:02,409 [Chi]
But that is your cross to bear. If you understand, that's one of the... that's the most important... that's the part... And this is the part that Christians... That's why it's the abstractness that I dislike about the Christian message that I... that, that makes it... Ew, this thing hurts God. God cried. Dude, fuck God. Uh, to be honest, fuck God. Who the fuck is God? What are you talking about? God cries every time. No, God doesn't fucking... Who the fuck is God? What do you mean? As a matter of fact, you cry, you feel bad about yourself whenever you do some shit that you know is bad, that... but that you know is probably bad for you, that you know is probably cutting you off from the relationships that you should have in this world. The reason, by the way, why potentially I would say masturbation is bad is the extent to which it removes the drive to go out and speak to other human beings and to connect with other human beings, and, and, and it removes the drive and the, and the, the instinctual thing that you have, that will, that will... even despite... fuck it, oh, f-... despite your, your, your, your sadness and your, and your lack of knowledge of how to be outside, you will get your... Uh, if you have not masturbated, you will get your ass up and you will go on another fucking Tinder date. You will go on another fucking Bumble, you will do another hundred fucking swipes. You might spend a little bit of extra money on that fucking course or that fucking coaching thing, or that fucking, uh, thing for... to make money or that business, because maybe, maybe, maybe you could fucking take that goddamn edge off. Oh my God, God damn it.

00:48:02,409 --> 00:48:53,719 [Chi]
So the, the extent to which masturbation is bad is, is the extent to which it removes the fucking edge. It's not bad 'cause it exists. Who gives a... Bro, what, what are you gonna... This is biological fucking thi- Things aren't bad just because of their... They're bad. They're, they're bad potentially because of the effect that they have on your life and, and the way that you interact with other people, and that's a, that's an individual thing, and that's a moment-to-moment thing. Sometimes masturbation is fine, and sometimes, you know, taking that edge off before you meet somebody can, can help purify your intentions with that interaction. So you can understand yourself a little bit better, and same for them.... and sometimes it, it, it, sometimes it- it's, uh, you know, it- it- it removes the desire to really sit there and- and be with somebody. Sometimes you gotta use that shit.

00:48:53,719 --> 00:49:01,440 [Chi]
So there's levels to i- it's not... And, and, you know, this guy I was talking... You know, I was talking to this guy, and I was like... And, and, and, uh,

00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:28,919 [Chi]
he's like, all that, you know, "God cry..." He was crying. I, I was cry... I cried a little bit as well. It's like, he's crying. It's like, "Bro, it don't..." Like, and 'cause these, these Christians, they have this such a d- such a bad opinion of themselves. Such a terrible opinion of themselves. "I'm dirt. I'm lower than dirt. I'm piece o-" Like, listen, and by the way, ironically, hey, I'm talking shit on clear right now, my opinion of myself is not much better. But,

00:49:28,919 --> 00:49:42,639 [Chi]
you know why my opinion of myself is not much better is because of my beliefs. It's because of the way I've defined failure and success. Man, I get up every fucking day and I try. I really fucking try and, and, and a lot of the days

00:49:42,639 --> 00:50:08,299 [Chi]
there is, there are things that I should probably be doing, but for whatever reason, my focus is elsewhere and in a way that is sinful, and in another way, I'm doing the best that I fucking can out here. So should I torture my- Should I throw myself off a fucking, uh, you know, the side of a building 'cause I'm doing the best... Nah, man. Get up,

00:50:08,299 --> 00:51:19,899 [Chi]
get your ass up, cry, even smoke some weed, take a pill if you got to, a couple tu... And hey, listen, relapse a little bit and then come back. You know what I mean? You do what you gotta do to fucking... not to survive in this fucking planet, man. And you know what I mean? I... To be honest, like, fuck it, right? Do what you gotta do to fucking survive on this goddamn planet, man. This shit is not easy, man. Man, I s... I, I see people that kill themselves, I'm like, "Shit. Shit, bruh. Hmm." You got that conviction. By the way, hey, I don't... that suicide could be right. That's righteousness. I... You was like, "I'm gonna get the fuck outta here. I'm gonna get the fuck outta here." I... Listen, I'll never, I'll never call suicide. Listen, calling it cowardice. Shut the fuck up, man. Anybody calls that shit cowardly is just, you ain't been there. You ain't been there. You don't fucking know. If you knew, you'd shut the fuck up. That's it. That's just, that's simple. You only thinking about yourself. "Oh, it hurts me." And that... I under... Yeah, you're fucking gay. I can't ima... The pain of losing somebody to death is the fucking... One of the wor... It's the wor... As a human being, it's the worst thing in the fucking play. It... But

00:51:19,899 --> 00:51:24,939 [Chi]
at... You know what I... It's... That's...

00:51:24,939 --> 00:51:44,539 [Chi]
I don't know. Yeah. To me, you just didn't know. You know? And, and by the way, you know, it's not to... Giving people hope, definitely don't shame niggas. Like that's, that's... You know what I mean? "I, out of defiance, will kill myself because fuck you." Type shit. I, I'm a defiant nigga like that, but hey, I'm still here. But anyway, like...

00:51:44,539 --> 00:51:52,159 [Chi]
Anyway, the Christian shit, you know, we're the... we're the... we're lower than dirt. It's like, nah man. Y'all not... Like,

00:51:52,159 --> 00:52:40,219 [Chi]
that's not the point of the thing, you know? It's not this fucking, "We're slaves, we're these disgusting maggots," and it's... No, bro. We fucking children of God, just like Jesus was. That's what he fucking said. We all the same. That's the whole message. Jesus is came... He's the fucking same as us. That's what y'all keep saying. He died and it's the same as fucking us. He's the same as us. That's the whole point. So stop that shit, man. What are we doing? He accepted your sins. He, he's the worst sinner. He's the worst. If you think Jesus... Jesus is not the best, he's the fucking worst. He... I don't... By definition, he's became the fucking wor... He's the worst, and then he fucking forgave himself. Listen, the whole myth, the whole story is a little, a little ridiculous, but that's not the point. That's not the point.

00:52:40,219 --> 00:52:43,859 [Chi]
This whole thing of groveling and he was per... Like, listen,

00:52:43,859 --> 00:53:51,159 [Chi]
he may have been per... You could say he was perfect, all that. But he said... First of all, he said, "We, we all children of God." That's what he said, first of all, if you believe that. And second thing, he accepted all the sins. So he is the worst. Right? So stop it. He was the best. Now he's not. And then he became the best again, but then by definition, we all became the best again. So stop with the... Motherfu... Stop with this. Okay? You see, "You can't sin." That's what it says. I mean, to be honest, it says it right there, 'cause it's true. In a way, you can't, uh, you can't sin. If you, well, uh, what's the way that... I don't know. I don't know the way that that, uh, analogy works. But, uh, uh, this concept of, "No, you can't sin." I mean, by definition, if you, if you know him and if you accepted him and all that, you can't sin, according to this, according to this verse. So even if you denigrating yourself for sinning, you not sinning because you know the nigga. Like, I don't... it's not... I don't know what it is. I don't know what you call it, I don't know what it looks like. I don't know how you define your way out of that. It doesn't even make sense really. But anyways, paradox. Anyway, that's not even the point. Anyway, shout out to that nigga. Uh,

00:53:51,159 --> 00:53:58,739 [Chi]
but that's an E- Even preaching that, like, we gotta get that. Even getting that message out, you know. It's content on content. So,

00:53:58,739 --> 00:54:27,539 [Chi]
so we talk about, you know, the, the thing that's, that make the world a better place on the other side with this, it's the therapy business, man. It's the cognitive behavioral therapy and putting that shit out there. It's the coaching. It's the personal coaching. It's the cognitive behavioral therapy. It's getting in the motherfucking cut with people, sitting when they're... sitting there with them, looking 'em in the fucking eye and saying, "Yeah, man. Yeah, man. That fucking sucks." But I'm gonna tell you, listen, I'm gonna tell you like from... for real,

00:54:27,539 --> 00:55:03,213 [Chi]
I, I will, I will live with you and your mythology, but I will tell you, you are bullshit from within your mythology 'cause you are bullshit from within your fucking rule set. You not even living according to your own shit. You don't believe that 'cause you don't believe that.And if you don't believe it, then that's fine. But, like, find that shit, find the, find the thing that you actually believe. What do you actually believe? What's the thing, what, what's the thing that you, what's that, what's the real shit behind that? And if not, if you really believe in,

00:55:03,213 --> 00:56:03,413 [Chi]
okay. But, 'cause ain't no, you know, man, it, it... And I give the analogy, man, 'cause we, if you wanna say we worship somebody, which I don't like that term by the way. But if you worship God, and we all worship something, like for me, I can't wait to have kids. I c- you know, uh, but I would say, but, but by the way, by the way, like, I would never... I, do I put my friends and the people that I know above everything? No, I don't. I don't. I put the shit that I'm interested in the moment, uh, on top, you know? And I work on it, and I grind. And then, uh, and then, uh, and then everybody else comes, and then it's, and then probably his family after that. And, uh, and then it's, uh, fucking randoms, you know? And sometimes randoms are top, you know? It's just different things happen at different times, you know? And, and, and life is life. There's different... Changing priorities moment to moment, that is what it is. It's not even a meta thing. It could be a meta thing, but it's... You know, but it's, if we talk about what you prioritize, what you care about. If you told me

00:56:03,413 --> 00:56:09,693 [Chi]
that my kids... Man, can you imagine? My kids would cry.

00:56:09,693 --> 00:56:42,294 [Chi]
My m- my wife, my girl would cry, would be dea- dying inside 'cause I did it, 'cause I'm doing some shit? 'Cause I'm doing X? 'Cause I'm go- what am I? What, 'cause I'm going out to the club? 'Cause I'm getting drunk every fucking day? 'Cause I'm doing... 'Cause I'm ignoring them? 'Cause I'm fuck... Uh, bro, if you t- Ah, man, uh, uh, uh, some people, uh, m- blah, blah. Some, some people might not, uh, care, or, or, uh, they have their own issues that, that they need to work through. But truly,

00:56:42,294 --> 00:57:38,573 [Chi]
a motherfucker can't in, in two breaths, and they, they will. Can't say, you can't say you love your girl, you can't say you worship... I don't, I don't like that. Fuck that term. You can't say you put these people above every- You can't say you love and put these people above everything else, and then you're doing something that's making them cry, that's making them hate the world and hate, uh, the, the thing that you, th- because they hate the thing that you are doing so bad. And of course, there is context to everything. But as the analogy goes, man, you all are talking about Jesus. Why y'all talking about God like you have a fucking relationship? Are you telling me that you... And by the way, if you slip up, whatever the fuck slip up mean, people slip up. But if you consciously see some shit and do it, I mean, of course, sit, stuff happens, and the motive, we're human. But man,

00:57:38,573 --> 00:57:49,773 [Chi]
careful, careful. Anyway, that's what I'll say about that. Uh, I like... That's, that's a fun thing to preach.

00:57:49,773 --> 00:57:55,033 [Chi]
Fun thing to talk about. S- You know?

00:57:55,033 --> 00:57:57,453 [Chi]
But for me,

00:57:57,453 --> 00:58:03,013 [Chi]
we need to... Uh, yeah. So,

00:58:03,013 --> 00:58:07,113 [Chi]
uh, I don't think there's any other ideas that I had in general for,

00:58:07,113 --> 00:58:14,653 [Chi]
for business stuff. Let me just double check. Let me just scan. Uh, nah, I don't think so.

00:58:14,653 --> 00:58:16,413 [Chi]
No.

00:58:16,413 --> 00:58:27,013 [Chi]
Uh, therapy app, yeah, voice controlled assistance is like work. Um,

00:58:27,013 --> 00:58:34,733 [Chi]
yeah. Yeah, I mean, 'cause all, everything is like through... All those projects together are, are my life, man. That's it, you know?

00:58:34,733 --> 00:58:57,013 [Chi]
That's interest... That's it. So, and then we have the therapy stuff, which is the cognitive behavioral therapy. Cognitive behavioral inquiry, that's inquiry that, uh, Ameen, uh, Feliachi, you know, they, they got over there at the Three Trees Centers for Change and at UVI. And these are two companies, uh, UVI's the private sector and Three Trees Centers for Change is the public.

00:58:57,013 --> 00:59:10,233 [Chi]
Three Trees Centers for Change has, has, uh, has cognitive behavioral, uh, courses, uh, for domestic violence, for anger management, for substance abuse, uh, for...

00:59:10,233 --> 00:59:18,513 [Chi]
That's the anger, anger management, substance abuse, uh, domestic violence, uh, and there's...

00:59:18,513 --> 00:59:49,993 [Chi]
There might be one more. But it's basically those. It's, they're court-ordered courses, court-ordered classes. So people have basically another chance at life because of these classes. And this is an opportunity for us to teach them some of the, uh, uh, teach them some of the stuff, not that I'm really talking about, but to an extent, stuff I'm talking about, right? Obviously, not exactly. I'm spitting over here.

00:59:49,993 --> 00:59:56,913 [Chi]
But, and another, to another extent, maybe.

00:59:56,913 --> 01:00:04,713 [Chi]
You know? It's like 12 Step program. Anyway, people have the opportunity. People have the thing where they basically go...

01:00:04,713 --> 01:00:06,893 [Chi]
They're going through,

01:00:06,893 --> 01:00:08,653 [Chi]
um...

01:00:08,653 --> 01:00:13,133 [Chi]
Yeah, they're just, they get to go through these things and,

01:00:13,133 --> 01:00:15,633 [Chi]
uh, yeah. Okay.

01:00:15,633 --> 01:00:40,853 [Chi]
So, we have to hire people for that thing. All right? Right now, I'm working on their website. Uh, I have been working on the website for a little bit too long. Uh, I don't like the way that it's set up. I don't like the way that I'm doing it. I don't like anything really, but it looks okay. Everything is basically okay. But I'm just very unsatisfied and I'm, and I'm a little bit stuck, uh, in quagmire. And, and I need to fight through 'cause this is the part where,

01:00:40,853 --> 01:01:10,447 [Chi]
you know, there's like the Dunning-Kruger effect thing. Um, and I, I was watching this art video where he's talking about that, where we have like, you learn a little bit about something.You have the Dunning-Kruger effect, uh, confidence, and then you find out a little bit more about it, and then you fucking dip. And right now, we're in that dip, uh, with regards to this project, and we've hit that dip with regards to a lot of different projects, okay? And, um, and, uh, you know, it's kind of fighting through the dip right now.

01:01:10,447 --> 01:01:45,848 [Chi]
Okay. Uh, by the way, I did buy an animation, uh, course, um, and I bought animation, uh, classes, uh, basically at almost like a $500 value. Um, it's sitting literally in my fucking little inbox thing. I'm paying it off right now. It's like $180 every two weeks. And then probably like, uh, next week will be like one of the last... Uh, maybe in two weeks will be one of the last payments. That's one of the things that I wanted to dabble in a little bit more, um, ironically, with all of the AI agents and all this shit. Um, but,

01:01:45,848 --> 01:02:01,707 [Chi]
you know, truly, the purity... I think there's a purity in creation. There's a purity in coming up with ideas and reviewing things and thinking, uh, deeper. Um, there's the girl that... I give the example, I mean, there's a girl that...

01:02:01,707 --> 01:02:35,787 [Chi]
You know, these video essays. First of all, video essays in general. Like, there was a girl that did a video essay on sinners, and the breakdown of sinners that she gave, it's like... It was so thorough and so deep and so connected, interconnected with things in the world, that it's just... There was no way that I would ever have come up with any of the connections or the things... Maybe one or two, but, like, the things that she was coming up with and talking about, I would have never came up with those things. And that's the magic of, of another human being who's in the cut, who's thinking and doing shit.

01:02:35,787 --> 01:02:52,907 [Chi]
She don't use AI for that motherfucker. She out here in the cut thinking, watching. She watched it two or three times, and I don't know... And her brain's cooking on stuff. And when you let your brain cook on stuff and you in the sauce, you make amazing things. And she's a screenwriter, and she, she's in the cut, and she makes amazing things.

01:02:52,907 --> 01:02:55,607 [Chi]
And I think more people need to be

01:02:55,607 --> 01:03:11,447 [Chi]
righteous and live in this way. I think AI is amazing. Everybody uses it every day. She even uses it for the fucking, you know, incidentally, as a part of the algorithm to, to make money and be alive on this fucking planet. But it's a tool,

01:03:11,447 --> 01:03:14,527 [Chi]
and abusing it

01:03:14,527 --> 01:03:16,447 [Chi]
is not righteous.

01:03:16,447 --> 01:03:18,667 [Chi]
It's not righteous.

01:03:18,667 --> 01:03:21,167 [Chi]
So, anyway,

01:03:21,167 --> 01:03:50,667 [Chi]
uh... So, we have a few things with that business right now. We, we have this website, which, uh, finishing this, the form for this website... By the way, which by the way, like, to be honest, if I'm being honest, that form, could we connect a fucking typeform to it and run them through that? And the typeform collects all their fucking information, and the typeform is integrated with fucking Stripe? Yes. So,

01:03:50,667 --> 01:04:23,167 [Chi]
me bothering with all this stuff is a choice, and I have to... Righteously, if I want to, I have to make that choice. If I don't want to do it, then I should shut the fuck up and get that fucking typeform or get that fucking... Whatever the other fucking flow thing is that we, that you want to fucking put out there. I should go and grab that and bring it over, because that's it. Either I'm gonna fuck... Either I'm gonna own my shit, and we can pay for typeform, and you can run people through it, or you can shut the fuck up and complete the thing that you fucking started with righteousness.

01:04:23,167 --> 01:04:25,607 [Chi]
You have a choice.

01:04:25,607 --> 01:04:28,967 [Chi]
You have a fucking choice. So,

01:04:28,967 --> 01:04:42,567 [Chi]
so yeah. So, I'm completing that, and that will free up some... That will free up a lot of energy and time that people are wasting for different things. People are wasting time right now on the flow. There's at least... About 10 steps

01:04:42,567 --> 01:05:27,107 [Chi]
of shit, of admin time, and even those individuals' time that's being wasted going back and forth, doing different things, paying, and whatever else. And all that could be streamlined and pushed into one area where it'd be super easy to control, uh, you know... Super easy to manage the payments and manage this stuff, and then ultimately manage... Yeah, manage the membership, manage the payments, and then ultimately even take their classes. You know, all this shit, theoretically, in my opinion, should have been done a while ago, but I'm working on a bunch of things, and I have ideas every fucking day. So, that's not the way the world works, but it is what it is. So, I think that is another one of the projects is completing that website, completing that form, because that form will, uh... Having that form done

01:05:27,107 --> 01:05:39,727 [Chi]
will benefit everybody, because it will, it will basically reduce... Yeah, it will just free up a few people that are already in the company

01:05:39,727 --> 01:05:56,227 [Chi]
who are being paid. Money is going towards them,

01:05:56,227 --> 01:06:23,027 [Chi]
and it will free up their time. So, that's the biggest, that's the biggest one, finishing that. Second level is kind of straight lining a lot of the other stuff, and one of the biggest things is starting to experiment with the Eleven Labs API and with their setup, with their RAG setup in general, where we'll be able to actually respond to people in real time, theoretically, if they, um... On their,

01:06:23,027 --> 01:06:27,927 [Chi]
uh, questions and on what's going on.

01:06:27,927 --> 01:06:48,987 [Chi]
So, probably we'd, we'd even theoretically have... Uh, we'd have AI agents, and we'd have facilitator co-pilots. Man, maybe one level is like, you just have to sit there for a little bit and listen to the AI cook, and then basically off of that, you know, from there you can, um...

01:06:48,987 --> 01:07:09,378 [Chi]
Yeah, so you sit off of that, let the AI cook.And then, uh, you know, and that's one level. So, just to have that human thing, and you probably do that for, like, six months, you know, just to make sure nothing's happening, make sure it's able to handle, like, different people, make sure people don't talk at the same time. Uh,

01:07:09,378 --> 01:07:37,417 [Chi]
make sure, you know, it's like, yeah, it's, like, probably one person talks at the same time, but people can respond to each other, and that's, that would be good to be able to take into account. Like, multiple people be able to do that feedback, do that thing, say thank you, and then, like, "Hey, who's next?" Or call them the next person. You know? And so being able to handle that, like, create an agent, uh, you know, who's able to come into calls, uh, and has memory as well,

01:07:37,417 --> 01:07:44,378 [Chi]
um, thing-to-thing, then that would be fantastic. 'Cause even, you know, bringing up somebody's profiles, like, "Ooh,"

01:07:44,378 --> 01:08:35,197 [Chi]
you know, "David is talking right now. This David has done this, this, this, this, and this. He's talking right now. It's what he released l- last week. This is what he's doing right now." And let's focus and see, you know, what, you know, this is what he's been even in trouble for and everything. And just even having that meta-context on everything that he's ever done. And even- even theoretically, you know, starting to come up with profiles and ways to deal with people, and way, no, uh, deal with people. The way- ways to interact best with specific personality types, that's something that we can really optimize when, you know, it's, uh, it's objective and- and we basically have this- this lever of control. So, starting to experiment with agents that can potentially lead these facilitator meetings and- and co-pilot, theoretically co-pilot and facilitate with, um,

01:08:35,197 --> 01:08:38,317 [Chi]
with people wou- would be interesting.

01:08:38,317 --> 01:08:40,857 [Chi]
You know?

01:08:40,857 --> 01:08:44,277 [Chi]
Very interesting. So,

01:08:44,277 --> 01:09:00,337 [Chi]
that's another, uh, that's- that's- that's a- that's another, that's a- that's a second project that needs to be worked on. And that is more of a developer thing, but it's not necessarily a developer thing. It's just somebody needs to sit down and do it. Um...

01:09:00,337 --> 01:09:09,597 [Chi]
Yeah, somebody should sit down and- and fucking start doing it. Yeah. So, and that's something you could pay somebody on Fiverr to do, to be honest. Um,

01:09:09,597 --> 01:09:22,317 [Chi]
you know, it's somebody that can be... Somebody could be paid to do it, and then basically, you know, we can evaluate the quality, you know,

01:09:22,317 --> 01:09:29,177 [Chi]
with- with energy, with time. And it's something I would hate. Rather- By the way, I would hate to, like,

01:09:29,177 --> 01:10:10,097 [Chi]
offload that, to be honest. But truly, truly, truly, very truly I stand to you, like, we need to start offloading stuff like this. It is a necessity because while I hate to offload it, to have something to test in a few days is something that can be iterated on, even if it sucks. Right now, we have nothing. In five days, we will have nothing. In three weeks, we will have nothing because I have not focused enough to complete some of the stuff that I'm working on. And then, uh, things pile up and these good ideas never get done. So,

01:10:10,097 --> 01:10:18,497 [Chi]
it doesn't fucking n- even really... On one level, it almost doesn't matter, the quality of the person,

01:10:18,497 --> 01:11:36,397 [Chi]
as long as they improve with time. And this is one of the concepts, I think, that I have... I understand with content, you know, and I preach with content, but I don't preach in my daily life with anything else. And this- and that is this, progress. Anything is progress. At one level, showing up is the battle. That is the battle. At one point, showing up is half the battle. And then, past that, then, okay, now you're showing up, now you have too much work. Then, you know, delegate it. Now you have too many ideas. Money is coming in. You have some money, now delegation is the battle. You gotta delegate. And then, past delegation, then maybe quality is the battle. Then you're fighting with quality metrics, and you're fighting with that. And then- and then scaling is a... But it's like you have to start the process. You ha- At this point that we're at, for me personally, we're at a point where showing up is the battle. And when I mean showing up, I mean literally pressing one fucking thing and letting somebody else do something that I know that I can do myself.

01:11:36,397 --> 01:11:47,237 [Chi]
But knowing that I'm not going to. And having that honesty, that's, I think, the disconnect. One of the things that... I think that's the- the undercover belief

01:11:47,237 --> 01:11:54,297 [Chi]
that I have, is that I can actually do

01:11:54,297 --> 01:11:56,677 [Chi]
all of that stuff.

01:11:56,677 --> 01:12:15,457 [Chi]
It's that underst- And- and- and by the way, can I? To an extent, yeah, probably. But will I? No. Do I have the time? No. So, it's like really being honest and saying, "I will not get this done. This will not get done by me."

01:12:15,457 --> 01:12:17,437 [Chi]
Because I

01:12:17,437 --> 01:12:22,817 [Chi]
am focused on this or something else. You know?

01:12:22,817 --> 01:12:28,397 [Chi]
So, and then having that honest moment, and then from there,

01:12:28,397 --> 01:12:33,417 [Chi]
we're able to make a clear-headed decision to say, "Okay, so

01:12:33,417 --> 01:12:39,317 [Chi]
we hire one person for two weeks, for a month, test them out.

01:12:39,317 --> 01:13:03,919 [Chi]
They do a good job, you know, keep them on probation, and then they're really doing a good job, we bring them on, protege, make them a dec- make them an offer." In our country, that works. Okay? But it's like we're at the point...And I'm preaching, but I also know that preaching doesn't mean shit.

01:13:03,919 --> 01:13:11,719 [Chi]
And it's the other part that I know from, I know from talking to girls and I know from coaching,

01:13:11,719 --> 01:13:17,299 [Chi]
and I know from all this stuff, is that

01:13:17,299 --> 01:13:25,639 [Chi]
saying the right words don't fucking matter. And real motherfuckers can see through.

01:13:25,639 --> 01:13:40,679 [Chi]
Real motherfuckers can see through, 'cause real motherfuckers just do shit, and then they tell you about it, and then you're talking about doing. And the conversation that you have with a doer is different than the fucking conversation that you have with somebody who's fucking talking.

01:13:40,679 --> 01:14:15,719 [Chi]
Somebody who's fucking talking is always saying, "Oh, I'm gonna meet with somebody next week, and we're gonna..." "Ooh, I'm gonna meet with the marketing director." "Ooh, I'm gonna meet with..." Stop fucking meeting with niggas and do some shit. You want to fucking record a song? Go fucking record a song, my nigga. When's the last 10 songs you recorded? When's the last 10 fucking videos you recorded? Why ain't, why ain't I seen that shit? When's the last 100 videos you recorded? When's the la- You know what I mean? What are we even talking about? Now of course there's a gr- Listen, you start somewhere. If you started, you started.

01:14:15,719 --> 01:14:22,219 [Chi]
But I think the other part about righteousness and wisdom, is by understanding where you are in the process. And for me,

01:14:22,219 --> 01:14:23,979 [Chi]
right now,

01:14:23,979 --> 01:14:29,160 [Chi]
where we're at in the process is de-le-fucking-gate.

01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:44,799 [Chi]
Shit that you're not gonna do, you have to delegate. It doesn't matter if you're better. It doesn't matter if you used to be viral on TikTok. It doesn't matter if you have knowledge. It doesn't matter that you are passionate about it, or you think that you're gonna do it best. Because,

01:14:44,799 --> 01:15:36,479 [Chi]
guess what is better? Um, because y- your best, uh, version of, of making a hundred videos that don't get made. Like, um, a shitty, uh, five shitty videos, um... What was I gonna... Five shitty videos are better than your best hundred videos that never get made. Okay? And five, and, and, uh, ten, uh, v- videos where somebody is scrolling and trying to engage with the algori- algorithm, a- a- and, and, uh, making these videos based on, uh, their own personal scroll data and their own understanding of how things are working. Ten videos from somebody like that is worth more than your five shitty videos of throwing something together, uh, from ChatGPT.

01:15:36,479 --> 01:15:43,919 [Chi]
And then, you know, 100 video i- video ideas, uh, with, uh, you know,

01:15:43,919 --> 01:16:06,419 [Chi]
100 video i- ideas with $200 per, you know, to, to, to vote towards Indonesians or Chinese or Filipino people, uh, U- UGC creators. Uh, 100 ideas from somebody who scrolls every day, and who has some decent viral, uh, intuition, and who pushes shit out is better than fucking

01:16:06,419 --> 01:16:36,219 [Chi]
your ten videos that come from your scroll recognition and knowledge. So, it's like everything... You gotta understa- so understand where you're at in the mothefu- If you are not that nigga, if you not that mothefucker that's willing to understand the shit, go find that motherfucker who is and hire them and let them do it. If you don't wanna do it, don't do it. That's fine. Not everybody can do it. And finally, if you have no money, then, uh, w- we'll, uh, if you have no money,

01:16:36,219 --> 01:16:45,799 [Chi]
then I think, then the main thing for people who don't have money is like, you have to understand your priorities at that point. What's the actual thing that's gonna get you to the next step?

01:16:45,799 --> 01:17:06,639 [Chi]
If you don't have any money, then the thing to, for you is not delegation. You can either find a fucking way to get that extra money, or you need to find a fucking good idea and you need to focus on the right shit. But at some point, then the, then the problem is, okay, got too much time and I got a little bit of money. I got not enough time and I got not a lot of money, but I have a little bit of money and if I want to get to the next step I got to fucking

01:17:06,639 --> 01:17:25,199 [Chi]
multiply myself. And that's, for me, I think that's where I'm at. Now, uh, do I have the money? Not necessarily, but I think the businesses and the concept, the, the, what I... I think we have the net... We have money. Uh, well, let me connect myself with the fucking business that I'm a part of. Three Trees, we have money. UVI, we have money.

01:17:25,199 --> 01:17:39,919 [Chi]
We're good. Let's fucking cook with it. Just c- let's cook with it. I'm, I don't, I don't need to get a fucking salary from this shit to say, "I got it," okay? Let's cook with it. Let's fucking hire people. Let's cook with it. All right?

01:17:39,919 --> 01:17:42,439 [Chi]
So,

01:17:42,439 --> 01:17:45,019 [Chi]
I say all that s- 'cause I'm preaching.

01:17:45,019 --> 01:17:51,659 [Chi]
I'm preaching. Uh, I think the biggest thing with all that is...

01:17:51,659 --> 01:17:56,199 [Chi]
So, I think the biggest thing with all that is...

01:17:56,199 --> 01:19:49,706 [Chi]
At the end of saying all that, okay. Uh, so, just so, somebody, for example, you know, I will finish the websi- if I don't finish the website, like, tomorrow, then we have to hire somebody to finish the website or just switch completely, eh, to type form and we just gotta connect the unroll now to the type form and then ha- hire somebody to, like, finish the actual form on the actual website and then, like, fully. Shut the fuck up, done. I can't do it. Somebody else gotta do it. All right? So I'll finish it tomorrow and it is what it is. That is what it is. We gotta call it. My switch on Monday, if I don't have that shit done at midnight, will be a complete switch into recruiter. Now I'm a recruiter. I'm no longer cor- coding for Three Trees or for UVI. I am now a recruiter. Until I find one to three devs that are willing to, um, try some shit. That are willing to, that are w- that are willing to, to, to do something. That's it. It's just that simple. It's just that simple. It has to be that simple.What else? So, there's the site that needs to be made. We've talked about, uh, we've talked about... The site's number one. Second thing is the, starting the development of the agents that can possibly, um, help out and maybe even, uh, at one level, could take control over, over some of this stuff. But it's one, one of the things where it's pr- it's, it's gonna be co-piloting and probably the, you know, it might be something that you can trigger with a key. And you sit there and you just press a button and the, the agent can respond. It's, it's always listening and then, you know, you can kind of direct it, respond to that. Or like respond to that with, with the context of somebody else, you know? Uh, you know, we have to develop that co-pilot or that agent. Theoretically it could be a remo- right, it could, like, what, you know, what does a remote control agent look like?

01:19:49,706 --> 01:20:01,365 [Chi]
You know. 'Cause all those agents have the ability, like, for somebody to, to pause, to stop and to, and to type something in, to interrupt and to say something.

01:20:01,365 --> 01:20:06,245 [Chi]
You know? You can interrupt and say something. So,

01:20:06,245 --> 01:20:16,825 [Chi]
somebody sitting behind controlling it could be valuable. Right? Using HeyGen, using something like HeyGen, uh, yeah, then, then you can cook with it.

01:20:16,825 --> 01:20:21,625 [Chi]
Uh, okay, what else, what else? Um...

01:20:21,625 --> 01:20:32,045 [Chi]
Okay. So, there's that and that, okay. And then there's the, the idea of having a portal. And, and the o- the only thing, you know, the value add of

01:20:32,045 --> 01:21:38,145 [Chi]
centralizing everything into, into one portal is, is, is the idea theoretically that, you know, people can maybe have a different, uh, type of experience with the material and their course. Maybe they can, maybe we have an addit- uh, additional homework or additional modules or additional, like, an agent or something that they can engage with and even speak with, uh, about their thing. Almost, I don't want to say Pimsleur-like, but yeah, therapist-like, Pimsleur-like, where it's, like, going back and forth on the actual thing and then they go and complete their, their, uh, their stuff. So it's like, hey, you have to engage, like, 10 minutes, you know, 15 minutes a day with this thing and camera on, everything. Um, you know, it's like, it, it's a, and, and, uh, maybe if you do that, like, it'll be free. Ha. You know. Some level you could, like, potentially have that where it's like, hey, you, you get to engage with this for, for a while and it's just free. And you, and, you know, we have a trial run if you wann- if you wanna do it in addition to your course, basically, the course will be free. That's an idea. So, but the idea behind the platform is again, going in this direction of...

01:21:38,145 --> 01:22:38,165 [Chi]
Really, uh, of having all the pe- person's information in one place and making it convenient for them to learn and to become a better person. I think, because for me and I was talking to a guy yesterday. He was like, "Oh, they have to do it. If they have to do it, then fuck the UI. Fuck them." And I was like, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Nah, man. Who, like, why would you make a product that people don't enjoy? Even if they have, if, if they have to use your product, to me, that's a higher level of responsibility to, uh, provide a, a, a, a quality service. Because they have to use you. Somebody is forced to use you. Have some respect for the concept, for the, for the, for the, for the energy that, that that is. That is, uh, you, taking advantage of the monopolistic, uh, nature of that relationship, I think, is, is, is the evil and that's the capitalistic shit. Don't fucking take advantage of, of, the, the, the f-

01:22:38,165 --> 01:22:45,105 [Chi]
of the fact that, of the fac- the fact that somebody has to engage with you c- for a certain period of time.

01:22:45,105 --> 01:23:04,645 [Chi]
That's evil. That's fucked. And I, that's that, then you're like, you know, if you have a budget, you have a budget. But listen, to an extent spend extra money on the UI. Have it be a pleasant fucking experience. Don't ha- don't, don't, what, there's no reason why it should be hell. There's no reason why it should be bullshit. Why?

01:23:04,645 --> 01:23:06,965 [Chi]
Why, why should it be

01:23:06,965 --> 01:23:15,625 [Chi]
something that people don't enjoy or don't, aren't, they aren't having some, some level of, uh, enjoyment going through it? There's no reason, right? Come on, man.

01:23:15,625 --> 01:23:20,485 [Chi]
And to that point, maybe, you know, for me, I, I'm even, like, even when I, when I look at this

01:23:20,485 --> 01:23:23,445 [Chi]
form, and I even feel the energy of the form, I mean,

01:23:23,445 --> 01:23:51,265 [Chi]
truly, like, having, like, a flow where it's like, "Hey, enter your name. First name. What's your first name? What's your last name?And that, you know, what's your, your gender, you know? First and last name." You know, so give it, like, that type form type, like just one at a time, just go through it. Not overwhelming you on the page. Just let's roll... We're all gonna get where, where we need to go. We're gonna get where we need to go, no need to, you know, no need to do too much.

01:23:51,265 --> 01:24:36,945 [Chi]
You know? Maybe we go that direction. I don't wanna redesign the whole fucking form, but hey, I'm thinking about it. I ain't gonna hold you. Now I'm thinking about it. It's like when you have a responsibility for that. So, that's it behind like the development of that portal. That portal would have obviously integrated, uh, you know, uh, Google Meet or DailyJS. Uh, you know, DailyJS would u- use the WebRTC, uh, setup, you know, connection to basically stream that. And they have, uh, basically off the shelf stuff that you can really just plug into. Um, the only thing would just be like, yeah, well, just going through the, the costs and figuring out, like, in the end, what is the thing that makes sense. 'Cause in the end, I mean, we're paying for Google stuff anyway. We're paying for a Pro account. So, if you're paying for all that stuff, then

01:24:36,945 --> 01:24:46,825 [Chi]
just use it. Right? If you're paying for all that stuff, just use the full thing. You know, don't... Yeah, use it.

01:24:46,825 --> 01:25:24,083 [Chi]
Um, what else? What else was I saying? What else was I thinking about? Okay, uh, for, for them... Oh, fuck, I forgot. Yeah, there's, and then there's, uh, ads. We need Google Ads, we need Facebook Ads, and then even bigger than that, we need content. We need Google Ads, we need Facebook Ads, and then we need content.Um, and content, uh, I found this, uh, this guy, and I wanted to include it in this recording. This is a ridiculous, this is a ridiculous recording. I don't know how I'm gonna trans- you know, we'll have to like, whenever we pull this, we'll have to just separate it all out to, uh, vibes. But,

01:25:24,083 --> 01:25:27,304 [Chi]
or different things. But,

01:25:27,304 --> 01:25:48,023 [Chi]
you know, this guy, um, I respect him. You know, he went viral similar... Ah, I wouldn't say similar to me. He was, he, he went bigger than, than I ever did, and he made a lot of money with it. But...

01:25:48,023 --> 01:25:59,843 [Chi]
Um. Yeah. Cluely. This guy, Roy Lee. He, uh, he went viral for this cheating app.

01:25:59,843 --> 01:26:47,863 [Chi]
You know, basically a cheating app. And this, even this new app is, is basically just cheating, right? Um, but they have a funnel, they have a website, they have a product, they have everything and they're just pushing it, right? He said, "We got four million views, got four million views on Instagram with Cluely in the first week on completely new accounts. Here's how we run an insanely viral UGC farm." Now, I want to add, just at the very beginning, they're working with some of the, some goats. Katie X Socials, this is a girl that I, I identified years ago, uh, that h- has just... Her content is crack. Uh, not crack, but she understands

01:26:47,863 --> 01:27:07,803 [Chi]
hooks and she understands communication. She understands bait. She understands her audience. And I always give her as an example because she really does a great job. Um, to the point where I'm like shouting her out. Like I'm just, you know, I'm thinking about her. All right? I mean, she works for them. You know?

01:27:07,803 --> 01:27:13,263 [Chi]
She works for them. And there's another guy called Ben, Ben

01:27:13,263 --> 01:27:23,383 [Chi]
A-R-A-T-A-M-E, Ben Aratame, who I guess he has a decent, um, TikTok. I don't know who he is or what.

01:27:23,383 --> 01:27:43,043 [Chi]
But, uh...

01:27:43,043 --> 01:27:47,223 [Chi]
What else? Okay.

01:27:47,223 --> 01:27:52,003 [Chi]
Yeah, I need to, I need to go home and shower, dude. Um,

01:27:52,003 --> 01:27:59,223 [Chi]
I need to go home and fucking shower and then come back cracked. Yeah, I need to probably go home and shower real quick.

01:27:59,223 --> 01:28:11,663 [Chi]
I'm dirty. I just tried to take a half shower here, but it's just dumb. I just need to go home and shower. I'm like doing half-ass shit. I just need to go home and like do the real thing and come back. No reason to do half-ass shit.

01:28:11,663 --> 01:28:26,243 [Chi]
But I should've already... I probably should be recording this from the crib, doing all that, but it's all good. You know? Let's have that forgiveness. Get back, cook.

01:28:26,243 --> 01:28:28,063 [Chi]
Um,

01:28:28,063 --> 01:28:33,583 [Chi]
yeah. I want to read through this guy, what this guy says. He says, he says...

01:28:33,583 --> 01:29:11,483 [Chi]
I mean, 'cause I believe all this. And then, um, truly with, with regards to this, this is, uh, I mean, this is it. Yeah. "We got four millions, we got four million views on Instagram with Cluely in the first week on completely new accounts. Here's how to run an insanely viral UGC farm." Long thread. Uh, "One out of ten. The algorithm is not random, it is just not public. The algorithm will tell you exactly how good your videos will be by view count and it will not lie. If you understand nothing else, understand this: if you make 100 different videos, one of them will go viral. If 100 accounts recreate that video, 20 to 30 of them will go viral. Below is a detailed guide on how to implement."

01:29:11,483 --> 01:29:50,283 [Chi]
It starts with, "One idea guy. You need someone to generate 100 different video ideas. The only case where one in 100 videos does not go viral is if the person coming up with 100 video, uh, concepts is heavily lacking viral sense. Find somebody young with six plus hours of screen time. Once you find your idea guy, you need to find creators. Most people who make content have even 100K followers, don't get paid much at all. So they'll be very open to the idea of making content for money. Market rate for UGC creators is $20 to $40 per video, $1,000 bonus per million views. We pay biweekly and we're hiring.

01:29:50,283 --> 01:31:17,643 [Chi]
You can find creators just by cold out reaching on TikTok and Instagram. Pay content opportunity will get a response. If your account is not getting responses at all, buy an IG TikTok account with 10K plus followers." "You're looking for creator accounts who, with 10 to 100K followers, who are actively posting. People who are scared to, people are scared to post for any amount of money. So people who are already posting, you, you have to find those. Plus hot girls. Follower count does not matter. For them, a pretty face alone is a viral hook." And this is so fucking key, because this is something that I've found, is like there's so many people that will talk about posting videos and talk about making content, and I am one of them. I am not actively posting anymore. I am not in the con- in the cut anymore, but I talk about it. But I am not actively posting. And if somebody were to hire me to make content, they would be making the wrong mistake. And that's, to be honest, I probably sh- I, I'm gonna reach out to Ryan again and say, "Hey, man. Listen. I'm not the right guy for this thing, and I'll tell you why. It's because I am not actively posting." Uh, I think in, in the, in the cut, in the genre, if you wanna make stuff, you gotta start making stuff. I think you gotta start making stuff for yourself. And I'll be part of it, but I am not actively posting, so you should not trust me to actively post for you, because I'm not even actively posting for myself or for any of the stuff that I do need to be actively posting for. So, you need to find people, and we need to find people who are actively posting.

01:31:18,161 --> 01:31:35,501 [Chi]
... because most people are scared to post, and then you find how it grows. Every UGC curator should get one page brief and a quick onboarding, the TLDR of our brief is talk to the camera, don't mention Cluely in the first five seconds, and have a video prepared... Uh, have video be related to Cluely's capabilities.

01:31:35,501 --> 01:32:04,042 [Chi]
So, give your creators freedom, your ideas are only... Uh, your ideas are only inspiration. Uh, you have the ability to es- your ability to scale is strictly... Uh, determined strictly by the capital you have. Cluely is aiming for 1,000 new UC creators by the end of the summer. This method's unpatched, and we're probably gonna scale to 100 million views per month very soon. As soon as you hit a point of positive cash flow in your conversion funnel, the mathematically correct play is to put all your money into it.

01:32:04,042 --> 01:32:56,181 [Chi]
The next step, we're currently here, is doubling down on what is viral. All of your creators should be meeting once a week with a content coach, should be going through each of the creator's accounts and telling them what to improve. Your creators will not get better unless you coach them on how to get better. Once they get coached, superstar performers will emerge, and those will drive the 90/10% of views for you... 90% of views for you. Cluely has the best content coaches in the world, and I agree th- I... That at least the one girl is, is cracked. That's it. We're trying to figure out operationally how to scale with thousands of creators instead of dozens, but we've already done four million views in a few days, and it's a no-brainer that we will grow. We're gonna crack virality. You have the best content marketing team in the world. I took over at Tech Twitter f- for months, and I will do the same everywhere. Attention is all you need. Ben Aratayim and Katie X Socials

01:32:56,181 --> 01:32:58,601 [Chi]
run the whole operation, and

01:32:58,601 --> 01:33:03,421 [Chi]
it's cracked.

01:33:03,421 --> 01:33:31,241 [Chi]
Um...

01:33:31,241 --> 01:35:53,381 [Chi]
Uh, I'm gonna answer this person. He said, "How do you get these content coaches? This is not a role I'm familiar with."

01:35:53,381 --> 01:36:01,601 [Chi]
I'm just, uh, writing this out. Your idea... Yes, how do you find these content coaches? I said, your idea, guys,

01:36:01,601 --> 01:42:59,831 [Chi]
would be...Uh, somebody asked, "How come the exact same video that got a million views can get a hund- 1K views? What's the answer to that?" That's a stupid question, first of all. But I would say how, how, how come? It's because the algorithm doesn't work on a dime. It's...

01:42:59,831 --> 01:43:10,971 [Chi]
Okay. Wait, um...

01:43:10,971 --> 01:43:20,812 [Chi]
Anyway.

01:43:20,812 --> 01:43:32,851 [Chi]
Yeah, fucking insane, right? So this is Cracked. Um, anyway, so sorry. I'm just redo that. Yeah, so anyway, I need to go back home and, uh...

01:43:33,613 --> 01:43:39,073 [Chi]
... do a real quick shower, and then we're good. But yeah, um,

01:43:39,073 --> 01:44:24,073 [Chi]
yeah, so, uh, I am an idea guy to an extent, and I could be that idea guy 'cause how long does it take to put together like 100 ideas? For me, I mean, but, uh, to the point, to the point, to the point, to the point, like, keeping up on all your creators, keeping up on everybody that's doing that, you need people, you need somebody who is dedicated to that shit, who eats and drinks and lives in the sauce of that. Not somebody, "Ooh, once a week you kinda engage." It's like no, no, no, no, no. Somebody who's in that shit, who lives, breathes, and loves the fucking game. Not somebody who's eh, half-assed, real fuck bullshit. So you gotta, you gotta, you gotta be in it, and that's it. So, to be honest, you know, I need to find

01:44:24,073 --> 01:45:24,213 [Chi]
whoever I was, like, three years ago making that bullshit, making that fire, you know? And I found a couple people. There's a few people. But there's also, like, there's people who make content. There's a, there's a two sides, right? 'Cause there's an understanding. I do think there's a, um... I think those people who make content about making content are interesting, because I do think that they do understand something about the game, and I think that they possibly could have good insight into organizing and distributing content, even though I think that they are kind of running, in a way, kind of a scam thing. But it's not a scam thing. I mean, tr- truly, like, people need this shit, and I need this shit. I wanna hire a couple of them so they can actually. So I can get some shit done, and I don't have to, I don't have to look at that shit every day. You know what I mean? Like, we need somebody who's in the cut. And then, further than that, we need somebody... We need some people who are outside doing that shit. Right? Like a guy that I see that's out here interviewing, like he's grinding. Like, dude, if you, if you offered him, "Hey, you go out $40 a fucking day, do this shit."

01:45:24,213 --> 01:45:42,593 [Chi]
Like, you think he's not gonna fucking do it? Dude, he'd fucking, in two seconds would do that shit. You know what I mean? It's like, of course he's gonna do it. You offer him fucking money? Just go out and film a video. Easy. Easy, easy, easy. So, and even, especially these pickup guys, you know?

01:45:42,593 --> 01:45:49,573 [Chi]
Um, a lot of these guys with the glasses. I'm, I'm looking to, looking to getting that and paying them. So,

01:45:49,573 --> 01:46:22,213 [Chi]
uh, and, and, you know, even co- and coaching that, you... So it's a lot of things. It's a lot of things. So, it's like, okay, so, so we need to hire... So having an idea person, and then starting up that farm of content, 'cause truly that's more valuable than the ads. Like, spending money on that and developing that side is more real and more interesting than the ads. 'Cause truly, I mean, to, to distribute and get your name out there, especially with, when you're doing good work, do good coaching work like this, it's just, it's different, you know? Um,

01:46:22,213 --> 01:46:48,413 [Chi]
it's just different, you know? And having a, a different level of an effect on the world, and then offering that job out, and really telling people, "Hey, you can make $70 an hour. You can do this. You can get in the pipeline, you know?" And if you are able to, you know? And if you're able to sign a local thing, you know, you can, ah, you know, having like a crazy, you know what... 'Cause that's another part, like, even having a...

01:46:48,413 --> 01:46:52,213 [Chi]
I'm heading out right now. Like,

01:46:52,213 --> 01:46:55,773 [Chi]
setting up an insane,

01:46:55,773 --> 01:47:27,253 [Chi]
uh, deal for people. 'Cause like even... So for me, even right now, so even having a crazy deal that's available, affiliate deal, where it's like, dude, if you went and you were able to sign, like, salespeople, whoever. Like, if you're able to sign and get people from the local government, from the local death office, if you want us in your thing and you advocate for us, you like li- like, to an extent, if you got us into a new state, there's gotta, there's gotta be an insane deal for these people. Do you know, you know what I mean?

01:47:27,253 --> 01:47:30,793 [Chi]
If you bring us into a new state...

01:47:30,793 --> 01:47:36,213 [Chi]
You know, 'cause it's not about money, it's about... 'Cause to me, there's a, there's an hon- like there's a, like, the honest part, it's not about money.

00:00:00,119 --> 00:00:05,259 [Chi]
Given my hour and 47 minutes, I got cut short, but

00:00:05,259 --> 00:00:11,159 [Chi]
it's okay. I don't know what I was saying. Uh, what was I saying? Um...

00:00:11,159 --> 00:00:46,439 [Chi]
Yeah. So, we need- so, we need idea, uh, we need an idea person or we need somebody th- that's running the ship as far as on that side. And the person who's running the ship on that side actually needs to be decent, actually needs to be like a person who- who understands the game and who literally is on the phone, like in the cut, looking at shit all the time. And who understands trends, who understands movement, who understands how to take advantage of shit, and c- who can move fast on something and get content out. Like I've said, if there's a trend and everybody can get on it and you have a farm, hey, everybody

00:00:46,439 --> 00:01:27,879 [Chi]
, like, extra money if you... You know, it's like post this right now, $30 for the next 100 people who post this video, $20 for like... You know, it's like $10 for the, um, 500 after that or some shit. You know what I mean? And then, I don't know, uh, probably also look up... 'Cause there's two sides to it. There's like, there's also that scale, how do things actually work? 'Cause we're not made of money, but, you know. Hey, you know, I wanna cook. I wanna help niggers. I wanna give back, you know. Um, Uvi is a g- great example. I don't know, like, a lot of the money is going towards something, but it's like, what, you know... Um,

00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:52,219 [Chi]
so all that needs to be fucking automated, man. Well, fucking even that understanding, like who, where... The amount of users, how do we even know who's dropping off or who's not dropping off? Like, I haven't heard like, are we hiring new people on that side? You know what I mean? Are we scaling every single month? There's a person calling leads and stuff, like, what's happening with that? You know,

00:01:52,219 --> 00:01:55,299 [Chi]
it's like hiring somebody, like literally

00:01:55,299 --> 00:02:46,559 [Chi]
hire somebody to be in charge of that so we understand what the fuck is going on, 'cause we don't even know what's going on. Like, somebody needs to be in charge of that or just s- in charge of setting that up, which by the way could be... Oh, like that's even another side. That's e- another project, where it's like, Uvi, that business over there, like, we literally need to just have a dashboard that is set up to understand how many active paying users there are. And then how many active, uh, classes are there and who is running those classes? Uh, and how full are these classes? Uh, when do we need a new facilitator? How close are we to needing a full facilitator? How, what are the recordings like on that end? Are we, uh, do we have any level of quality control over what's going on over there? Are people fucking? Are people talking? Uh, are people having personal relationships? What's going on on the Uvi side? I don't fucking know. I don't fucking know.

00:02:46,559 --> 00:03:09,699 [Chi]
You know what I mean? So somebody, like we need a fucking, um, we need a dashboard, like we need a m- monetary dashboard. We need to see how many people are coming into the meetings every single time. Uh, we need to be monitoring how late people are or early or whatever, and generally and just interacting with them i- to understand how- how they're doing. And then potentially again, like, so that's like,

00:03:09,699 --> 00:03:54,279 [Chi]
that site needs to be redone, not necessarily redo- but that site needs to be redone so that it's optimized, um, 'cause that site will actually be running a lot of stuff towards. And then honestly, I mean, the same thing with the, it's the same thing with Three Trees. I mean, we'll be up running a lot of stuff towards Three Trees. I mean, the idea of Three Trees is fucking, it's crazy, all right? It's like getting stuff out there and getting people to understand the value of recidiv- of reducing recidivism and the value of not, you know, you know, it's not the liberal shit where people are like, "Well, let's, uh, decriminalize everything and just have people do..." No, it's fuck all that. It's about teaching people the consequences of their actions. Not in- in- in a, in a, in a, like

00:03:54,279 --> 00:04:11,519 [Chi]
in a meta fashion where it's like, um... In a way where it's like, "Hey, listen, you have these desires in the world and if you behave in these ways, you won't get the desires that you want in this world." You know?

00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,679 [Chi]
Right, right, right.

00:04:14,679 --> 00:04:17,579 [Chi]
All right, thank you.

00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:47,999 [Chi]
And you tell people, "Listen, this is how this is working. I- if you, you have desires in this world..." And even the people, even the, even if you wanna select evil people, like whatever, like people that are like out here doing murders or like, even them, it's like, what do you want? Like, you wanna feel powerful? What is it the thing that you, that you're after, the actual thing? You wanna feel powerful, you wanna do... Like, you could actually have a lot of that stuff and it's sustainable, uh, in a different fashion, you know? So it's even a different, uh, context that you're coming at people with outside of,

00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:54,039 [Chi]
uh, outside of the, outside of that shit, you know? And that's one of the,

00:04:54,039 --> 00:04:57,939 [Chi]
that's one of the potential cool things.

00:04:57,939 --> 00:05:07,099 [Chi]
That's one of the potential cool things.

00:05:07,099 --> 00:05:15,659 [Chi]
So yeah, creating, you know, tracking that, so we need to... So we were working on the forum, working on the platform thing on the, on the, on the, um,

00:05:15,659 --> 00:05:47,779 [Chi]
Three Trees, you know, which is the public side, but we didn't work anyth- on anything for, for the private side. The private side needs a lot of work and the person who's running... And hon- honestly, we need to kind of figure out that structure as well, so how is the ownership or how's the thing structured across businesses. Um, and, and how to make it to an extent legit, and to an extent, you do need it legit, you know? If somebody's getting paid, they're getting paid. Pay them in crypto, who gives a shit, right? You cook it, you know? Um, but at the same time, it's like, uh, what, what else? Um,

00:05:47,779 --> 00:05:58,939 [Chi]
yeah, we need, so we need a content person. I think a content person would be more valuable than a Google Ads person, but I do think we do spend money on Google Ads to get con- to get people in. And it's like,

00:05:58,939 --> 00:06:31,169 [Chi]
honestly, if we just took all that, to be honest...We spend, what, five grand a month. If we just took all that and were just like, "All right. Let's find... Let's reach out to one of these people and say, 'Hey, you wanna run our UGC for us?'" You know? And when I say UGC it's like u- r- run our, uh, like, run our influencer network. So the whole idea here is that we're running this influencer network and we're slowly building up our network of people, of UGC, of, of creators that Oh, shit.

00:06:31,169 --> 00:06:36,450 [Chi]
Are putting together the list of creators

00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:40,150 [Chi]
who can make shit.

00:06:40,150 --> 00:07:23,849 [Chi]
Yeah, you're putting together the list of creators who can, who can get shit done and can make shit. All right? And who can get shit done on time and, um, and fast. You know? Um, and ultimately, I mean, i- i- at the same time it's like put, you know, then you could obviously have the incentivize the facilitator. We had all these ideas a long time ago, but noth- again, it's the biggest thing is that you need a human, somebody to push it. You need somebody to push it. And that could be an agent, but it's not right now. You need somebody to push it. You need somebody to be active in saying, "Hey," reaching out to creators. Um, you, probably a human being. A human being from a real account that they have, "Hey, paid opportunity. What do you think?" You know? And then you see what's good. All right?

00:07:23,849 --> 00:07:52,789 [Chi]
Um, there's a lot of scams and shit, but I think reaching out to people with that, "Hey," you know, from a real account, my shit, especially my shit, you know? Get a couple people on my shit, say, "Hey, reach out to people on here." Which is, like, you know, at scale. Uh, get a bunch of people, start to build it up. You posting content yourself and you're reaching out to people, being authentic. All the, all these burner accounts, all this shit. Like, we, we'll have some burners you fucking run through, but, you know,

00:07:52,789 --> 00:08:03,789 [Chi]
you gotta be outside. So, uh, this will be, s- I'm saying a lot just to say we need a content person, but I'd like to, you know, i- organize all the information and the, and the vibes as well because truly,

00:08:03,789 --> 00:08:53,649 [Chi]
um, like truly there's so much shit, and I have a lot of knowledge but, you know, there's that guy, theo.gg. Like, he is a good developer but at the same time he can't, like, be maintaining every single project that he's doing by himself that he has. You know? He has his passions, he has his something. The model, the model comes out overnight and he wants to code, he wants to, like, manually code it all and just, like, it's, that's his choice and that's, h- he gets to work on that 'cause he has a, at least a small team, couple people, or at least a few contractors that he can... And he also, it's his own, own content network. He's his own content, shit. So he doesn't, you know what I mean? And his projects are niche, his products are niche. He's not going, like, mass appeal. He makes enough money doing all this stuff. And, and then he obviously makes a lot of money on Twitch and all these things, so it's like, he's doing fine. And he also has all those sponsors. So it's a good setup,

00:08:53,649 --> 00:09:50,949 [Chi]
uh, for cross-pollination. You know? So, so hiring, so... I don't know what we went over. Um, so we need to hire, like, a, a, somebody to lead that. Somebody to lead UGC. Uh, we need somebody to lead UGC. And then, uh, from a marketing standpoint, I don't like the idea of a marketing director or a marketing person, but I, look, we need somebody on the ads side. And it's somebody, it's probably somebody very similar to who, whoever's, whoever's doing the UGC. These niggas need to be intact and they need to be working together, vibing, understanding, um, what's working, what's not working on both sides and then pushing things in both directions. Um, 'cause if some ads are working, something's working on the UGC side, we need to push it. And if something's working on the ad side, we need to push it. Right? And I think most of the stuff, obviously, that's gonna be working, most, obviously all the creative that's coming from the UGC side, that's gonna feed the ads.

00:09:50,949 --> 00:10:32,769 [Chi]
They're not, they're not gonna be operating in the dark. The ads are more about, like, optimizing the content once you have the content, once you have the stuff, you're not doing the creative, you're just pushing it out to the audiences that you know it should, should need it and then you're optimizing the, the flow of the money based on the accounts, based on the things that are actually letting it spend and doing what they need to do. That's my understanding of it. You're changing the parameters, you're changing the, the, uh, demographics and you're adjusting to who is responding to certain things. And then whoever's responding to it, you double down, you pay more, and then whoever's not responding, you, you, um

00:10:32,769 --> 00:10:37,029 [Chi]
maybe you cancel that and you, and you move on and try something else. So,

00:10:37,029 --> 00:10:50,689 [Chi]
that's the two, those are like two sides. And of course, so this, and there's a creator network to kind of have, be generated through that. And it's just even to, to have somebody, like, to give, s- like, I would s- I would love like, "Hey,

00:10:50,689 --> 00:11:32,049 [Chi]
go through this thread and then also, like, literally do, like, one week of research." And then just cut, like, fucking find all the Discords, join, get fucking cracked, just research, go, like, down a deep, deep rabbit hole and then just see what other niggas is doing. If you, and then once you, and then, then, you know, just once you see that, this is, 'cause this is, is, you know, once you're in those communities you also just start to generate, like, your own, "Oh, okay. Oh, do this, do this, do this, this." Then you start generating your own ideas and when you start scrolling you also generate your own ideas. Like for me, man I see fucking crazy shit every fucking day, man. See crazy fucking shit every day so I'm like, "Ah, man." It's so much shit. And for me

00:11:32,049 --> 00:11:34,229 [Chi]
it would be lovely,

00:11:34,229 --> 00:12:06,549 [Chi]
um, like, I should be way more... The shit that I'm doing right now, I should be doing that s- I should be that everyda- uh, all the time. I should be preaching. You know? I should be preaching my anti-pro-religion shit out here 'cause it's fucking based and people need to hear that. I gen- genuinely think, you know, it's like, "Hey, the people get the wrong idea of, uh, people got the wrong idea from this debate. People took the wrong thing from this." It's not about... Jordan Peterson is actually right, but not in the way that you think.

00:12:06,549 --> 00:12:22,880 [Chi]
And then break that down. You know? And t-George Peterson got destroyed. George Peterson got destroyed this way, but it's because he's committed to his... Ah. But it's because,

00:12:22,880 --> 00:13:01,679 [Chi]
uh, of this reason. And, you know, it's going down. Oof. I should be... You know what I mean? 'Cause there's, there's lot of perspectives, a lot of things... For me, I'm more serious, but I'm also fun. Like, for me, I, my, my personal profile would be base. I'd be g- I'd be giving them, I'd be, I'd be pop, pop, pop, you know? I got so many sides and shit. I'd be, I could be rocking, rocking and rolling, you know? I got my clothes, I got... But, anyway. We gotta put people in possession. And to a large extent, a lot of things can be automated. A lot of thi-... And I fucking hate that. Like, when I say automated, I don't mean that. I mean, a lot of shit can be done, but I do think

00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:39,559 [Chi]
there's a level of... Put people, empower individuals, and pay p- real, real human beings. And, and to an extent, hey, get robots involved when robots need to get involved. Then at some level, robots will take over everything, and that is fine. But right now, they will not, do not. And robots do not understand content. Robots do not understand scroll. Robots do not understand vibes. Robots do not understand your brand and your personality. Robots do not experiment at that level. They're not there. They're not there. So that shit's gonna go viral.

00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:52,779 [Chi]
And the fucking viral isn't even the fucking goal. None of this is gonna go anywhere. You ain't, you ain't gonna build a following. You're not gonna build loyalty. You're not gonna build anything 'cause you not nobody and you putting out bullshit. Okay? So there's content side.

00:13:52,779 --> 00:13:58,160 [Chi]
So it's like, building out those two portals. Uh, building out like, those forums.

00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:49,239 [Chi]
I don't, I don't... I- I'm like, talking about them in abstract, how you're able to connect everything. Building out like, both of those two businesses, the forums and everything. Um, and then it's like hiring the admin to manage the, uh, flow of the workers and the facilitators. This is probably one of the bigger things. It's like, uh, the CEO right now is like literally... He's having to hire people, fire people. He's having to like, take on classes by himself. And obviously this impedes his ability to, obviously even have a personal life, but, you know, it impedes his ability to work on onboarding new, uh, uh, PO offices and reach out to people. Eh, eh, it's, it's not good for him to have to waste his Saturday or, uh, uh, any, i- individual day doing some of this admin stuff when...

00:14:49,239 --> 00:14:55,679 [Chi]
You know? And, and then there should be a lot of triggers. Like, for example, you know,

00:14:55,679 --> 00:17:13,119 [Chi]
there should be somebody, like, on the admin side, there should be somebody who's f- full-time, who's sitting there during like, every hour that we have active classes, like, not monitoring all the classes, but yeah, like, in a way, like a security op, like, kind of monitoring the classes. You're kind of like hopping in and out of different ones, just like, looking at what's going on, just double checking, you know, the, the vibes. You know, making sure... You know, when I... And then somebody that's... It's like... So ma- so l- literally we need a content control moderator 'cause like, we've had a lot of issues lately where people are ending class early, they're not giving the right feedback, they're giving out personal information. They're not able to respond to, uh, these issues that... You know, just feedback, give people feedback on their stuff. And they really need the feedback on their stuff, because, you know, if they're doing domestic violence, man, this is not a fucking joke. That's the other part about it, which like, some people an- and the way that maybe we're engaging with this i- is we're even communicating it the wrong way. We're communicating it like, "Hey, here's $70, and do this easy job." It's like, the way that nee- it... This needs to be communicated is, you are changing lives. Truly. Like, you are truly... Like, somebody out in the world, like, doesn't... You know, uh, you know, obviously they get caught and everything. They called the police. They po- could potentially get out of the cycle, the vicious cycle of domestic violence, or the vicious cycle of substance abuse, anger management, domestic violence, because of this class and because of the interaction with the material and because of you. And that is not something to take lightly. That is not something to fucking, oh, uh, g- go late. Eh, eh, you know, quit a class early. That is not something where... It's not a fucking paycheck, dude. Take it fucking serious, 'cause this is, this is real peop- this is real life. You're changing the course of one other person's existence, potentially. You know? And, and you're a piece in that process that could help somebody, uh, you know, really understand themselves and, and get to a better place in the world, where they can actually, um... Where they can live out the rest of their life in, in relative peace. And of course, they're gonna have troubles, but really understand the effect of their actions on their own goals, desires, and, and on the goals and desires of other people. And that's not something that should be taken lightly. So

00:17:13,119 --> 00:18:05,199 [Chi]
even communication. So somebody needs to be... So we need quality control to really manage these different things. So one level of quality control is that like hyper shit, where it's like, okay, I want somebody like, probably at all times. You know? I don't know what you're, what else you're doing. It's like you're bouncing in between... You know, during the active hours of classes, you're bouncing between meetings. You have probably like 12, you know, windows open. And you're able to monitor all of them at the same time. Um, ideally, o- obviously in the future it would be some cool thing where, you know, you... Almost like a security feed. You have all of the things in front of you, and you can just like cycle through, um, and just see what's going on. Um, and you can even just... I mean, like, the best case scenario in the world would... I'm just thinking of like, crazy futuristic shit. It's like, yeah, you're just, you just have like a dashboard of 50 classes in front of you, and they're all actively

00:18:05,199 --> 00:19:37,641 [Chi]
being monitored by, you know, AI agents, and they're being, you know, actively transcribed. That's like one level, where they're being actively transcribed.And they're being monitored by AI agents. And if something comes up, then you'll get a notification. You'll get pinged, you know, a potential issue or potential, uh, wasn't responded to correctly, and then you can go in, monitor, like just d- double check. Uh, and maybe you can even be able to, uh, intervene or add some context or, or help out in a way, um, in a, in an interesting way. And it, and it could, and it could be a cool thing where it's like, theoretically, your camera is also being streamed to everybody at the same time. Uh, and, um, like crazy shit, think of crazy shit where like, theoretically, even, like, and then if you start to talk on another person's video, for example, um, you're muted on all the other videos, but then even, uh, some, like, it, it keeps rolling like you're still, like, sitting there actively listening to them. And it doesn't show you in real life. Does that make sense? That, that would be fucking cool. Anyway, uh, that's like futuristic crazy shit. Keep the, you know, keep the... You know, it's like those movies where, like, uh, some shit's happening, going down and they just, like, change the camera feed real quick and it just looks like, uh, just a little bit, uh, continuov- continuance of whatever, a role and you're just sitting there looking at it. Um, but you could also just turn off the camera, you know. You don't wanna c- over-complicate shit.

00:19:37,641 --> 00:20:23,681 [Chi]
And then eventually, of course, at some future, you can have just an a- an agent actually running it. But then even, even that, like, you could probably, you would have a, uh, a, a human, you know, monitoring all the agents, making sure, uh, nothing is going wrong or if something gets flagged or if s- if the agent is hearing something and it's upset or, I don't know, but whatever, you know, we just flag it. Okay. Anyways, we need an admin. Um, the admin would be responsible for quality control, monitoring people, uh, and then obviously, like, going through the transcripts after all the classes are done. Just real quick, um, i- just doing a- an analysis. And they may need, may need to read through, uh, it's like if somebody, if something is flagged, then they go through and actually watch that specific thing

00:20:23,681 --> 00:21:19,341 [Chi]
and, um, and then they make a note on that transcript. So, there will be an objective level of, you know, something gets flagged, it's flagged and nobody can change that, but they basically have to respond to that flag. So they have to go in, look at that part of the video, look at the context and then respond to that flag. Almost like a JIRA issue, almost like a, a ticket. Like, a ticket gets, like, triggered... That would be interesting if we could do something like that, where a ticket gets triggered if it, if, if the system, i- if the transcript is able to, is recognizes a behavior or something that wasn't responded to or it recognizes that a, a class was closed too soon or recognizes that a class is starting late. It's like something gets triggered and then that gets pushed somewhere where somebody has to go check that, and that would be the admin. Uh, check it and then if there is an actual issue, follow up with that person,

00:21:19,341 --> 00:21:57,601 [Chi]
um, and obviously we have to have a system of, uh, uh, you know, chances and flags of... You know, the, uh, I was talking to, uh, Amin, the CEO, about it the other day. It's like there's gotta be things where it's like, yeah, if you do it you're fired immediately and there's other things where you're like, yeah, let's get like two or three chances and there's other things where it's like, okay, yeah, it is what it is. Life happens. But some things, it's gotta be like one and done. A few things, it's like you got three and out, it's not a fucking joke. We're not playing with, with... It's like people's lives, you know, it's not... And, and we're cycling through facilitators anyway, so it's not like people are getting used to anybody, it's just they won't miss them. They just won't see them a- again. So,

00:21:57,601 --> 00:22:41,861 [Chi]
what else? So, we need an admin. Then the admin would also be responsible for potentially, um, what I would, you know, uh, what would be... Right now I think the admin would also be responsible for potentially, um, i- they would be responsible for training new people so, um, or monitoring... Uh, yeah, be, uh, responsible for training n- new people. So the admin would have probably, you know, a, a few classes themselves, but the, the classes that they would have would be more, uh, for the purpose of, of training new individuals. So, um, so they would still stay in the cut, still stay saucy, but also they'd be a- able to train new people, um, and then, of course, uh, evaluate transcripts after that. Uh, best case scenario maybe, uh,

00:22:41,861 --> 00:24:04,021 [Chi]
yeah, we just have a few trainers, uh, that are designated and then the, the admin can just... The, the, uh, administrator or that person, operator, uh, can just do that exact thing, uh, just operate and just keep track of everything and make sure everybody's, uh, quality control and everything's good and see how, how big that can be scaled by one person and then, uh, look at it further than that. Um, we need somebody to actually handle the flow of people. We need somebody who's steadily, uh, bringing serious people in, um, who are willing to, uh, do the job and who are serious. Uh, we have to get some level of commitment from people, of course, their contractors, uh, but, you know, and it's something where, uh, we may wanna look into another, uh, situation, potentially like part-time, W2 or something. But, uh, 'cause that way, uh, if y- if they are, like, really working for you, you can, technically you can enforce the, the schedule. Technically as a contractor it's like if he, whether or not you can say, like, you have to arrive on a certain time or fire or something like that. It's kinda... Like set hours is leaning towards, uh, part-time. I'm pretty sure actually, to be honest, like legally you probably have to do part-time stuff, uh, 'cause... if it's set hours, but I don't know the rules about that. Probably can double check that for me if you want. But, uh,

00:24:04,021 --> 00:25:05,484 [Chi]
so we need that admin. And of course we need that same person on the Uvi side, uh, the private side. So the public and the private side. Uh, I talked about the content people, content, uh, you know. Uh, talked about the HR. We need somebody, like, actually re-You know, bring in the talent and, and, uh, distributing them, um, on that side of making sure that we have a nice flow of people coming in, and they're onboarded, and they're ready to go whenever pe- there's new classes or new things going on. Um, but then, somebody's in that... It could be the admin as well, but it's also, like, monitoring individuals and saying like, "Hey, do you wanna pick up another class? Do you want..." You know, like, keeping track of peoples' desires. And of course, a lot of that stuff can be, of course, can be... We have kind of a system. We can have levels of automation, but you know, that's s- that just has to be something that we, um, do. And I would love to have, you know, in-house tech that's built to handle all this stuff. Uh, I would love to be the lead, personally, of kind of the tech side, and just coming up with the ideations. You know, for me, I would li- I would love to be like,

00:25:05,484 --> 00:28:14,563 [Chi]
something like a COO or CTO, or some... 'Cause I, I have a lot of knowledge about... I don't like the titles, by the way, but I would... For me, I would be very comfortable just on a top level. You know, "Hey," you know, "This is the movement of, uh... Where it should be moving, like, generally with the content. I like it. Let's, like, continue or double down or whatever." Go deep with some people some days, not other days. Um, and then me personally, obviously making my own content, doing my own thing, uh, living my best life, hiring people for my own content. Of course, like, I want an idea guy for the Romper busine- like, for all my businesses. Like, I want an idea guy for the Rompers, to be pushing out shit, and then obviously, for the language learning stuff, you know, we need somebody, like, just to be managing, like, pushing, managing that. Um, I want a dev on, on my projects, you know? And- 'Cause like, the first part of the, even the rec- the other recording is literally all my projects, all the cool ideas. It's like, all my shit. Uh, nobody else, except for the construction stuff. Uh, construction, one, um, I, I do have a budget. I can have a budget. Um, he'd probably like me to build it by hims- by myself, but he would pay me to build it. And, uh, so I could probably... That's probably a priority, to be honest, in a way. So like, I could, he said I c- he could pay me to, like, put it out. So, I mean, I need, I do need money, and I do need to, like, flesh it out. So, probably, if you're being serious about money, um, the construction co-pilot would be a priority because he said I c- he could commission me, and he does have money, and he's cooking. Right? And so being... Like, positioning myself as the tech person, you know, or positioning of my company, Peacockery Dev., uh, Peacockery Studio, that was gonna be the name of the company, um, uh, that I was starting. It's under, you know, I have a LLC already called WE PEACOCK LLC, but Peacockery Studio, the idea just a- it's just this, uh... I just love peacocks, man. And Peacockery, it's like silliness, it's like jive, turkey. I don't know, it's just silliness, but it's beautiful and it's, it's vibery. And it- it's vibey, but the stud- and then the studio part's like, obviously there's content side and the creative, and then there's, um, obviously tech. So, I think it's like probably, I don't know what the... I don't like to, I don't wanna pigeonhole myself, but th- that'd be like my creative tech company where, you know, I, I wield my powers of coming up with bullshit and vibing, uh, for good. And so, I have a couple devS, um, what would be... Sick would be if I had like, you know, a couple devs that were cooking on stuff. Uh, maybe I have a- another vibe coder who's able to, you know, come up with quick, you know, prototypes. You know, similar to me, knows how to use cursor, loves the game, knows the models when they come out just like I do. Knows the new shit whenever they come out, just like I do. Knows the new TTS models when they come out, just like I do. You know what I mean? It's like somebody who's also in the cut, in the crack, um, who loves the shit. Could work with somebody like that. Um, as I go forward, obviously, I just

00:28:14,563 --> 00:28:14,663 [Chi]
Yeah

00:28:14,663 --> 00:30:03,143 [Chi]
... need like the people that I'm exist- that I'm working with right now are not those people. They do not care about the tech like I do. They don't care about the content like I do. It's not something that they're interested in. So, that's something for me to take a hold of and say, "I know the content and I'm talking shit on the content. Let me cook." But I need people on my side because I can't be doing this shit myself 'cause I don't have time and, to be honest, for some of the content and for some of the coding, I don't have the desire to finish the task. I don't have the desire to sit down and go through the Dunning-Kruger of finishing certain things. And, um, and that is a personal, you know, like, uh, we're fighting. And for this one, like, I'm gonna try to get... I'm gonna get it done, but for other stuff, like, dude, uh, even to, to, to this day, like, it's one o'clock, I haven't sent the... I paid like, $165 for this guy to do world building for me, and here, like... You know what I mean? I haven't sent him anything. So... But I'm gonna shower and send him stuff. Uh, is there anything else? Oh, um, script writers. I want a script writer for, uh, the language learning stuff. But I think, like, it's interesting, um, I'm... Like, I think the content person is very interesting for that world 'cause it's not... I need, I need some cracked content people in genre for the app, for stuff like that. If you wanna build out a quick world or build out something, uh, on that side, um, then it's like, "Hey, we..." And then, uh, on that side as well, artists and animators. So, artist animators that are able, able to animate in Rive and/or, uh, Blender/Unreal Engine. Um, somebody, people that are able to, to cook out stuff in those two things, especially if I have a backend ready, if I have some things ready to go. And then obviously, I'm, I'm trivializing a lot of game dev, but it's like,

00:30:03,143 --> 00:31:56,206 [Chi]
if we have some infrastructures and then we s- and then we're able to, like, move on different things over and over again, then, I mean, theoretically, it's like you, you also have a, a, a, a movement and a, an idea to get an investor or somebody who's willing to put in some money and get some money back. And then obviously, I'm able to cook and do something. That's where investment comes from. It comes from somebody who's recognizes that we're cooking off of shit, and we can push some shit out, and we're developing it, you know? So, anyway, um, hopefully that covers all this stuff. I mean-Um, for me personally, yeah. That's like for me, a dev or two. Um, I think there's also a level of like maybe possibly for me also a personal assistant, um, that just, like, does little bullshit for me. Maybe like managing a calendar or just like, "Hey, you got this coming up." Um, just staying on top of me to say, "Hey, uh, we have this going. Hey, you need to sleep. Hey, you need to go eat." You know, a- and that sounds retarded, um, but, and it is, but it's like, he- like I, like truly like for me even right now, I'm like, delay going to the shower. It's like, "Hey, stop everything. Go work on that." I need probably... I want a person that's, um, you know, that I hire to kind of keep me on, uh, different tasks or to, or, or to direct me in a way. And maybe until I'm able to do that for myself but it's like, "Hey, listen, keep me on that motherfucker." Or I de- or I delegate it. You know? If you see too much, it's like, "Hey, you have to go delegate that. You're not working on it enough. You have to hire somebody and delegate it 'cause, uh, what do you actually wanna work on? Or get your priorities straight. Work on it." Or, "Hey, you're disgusting. Go shower. Come back. If you wanna do a two-a-day at work, you can. But like, go sleep." You know what I mean? Like keep it... So, that's it. I think that's all the things that I would hire or even think about hiring. So admin, yeah, admin, talked about.

00:31:56,206 --> 00:32:16,485 [Chi]
Um, we kinda have s- a couple of people on the sales side for, for, uh, Three Trees and UVI. I mean, that, that would be like, you know, somebody's like picking up the phone or answering calls. Um, but you could also have AI do that. But, uh, yeah, some like, maybe sales. Um, yeah. Uh, that's all I can think about right now. I'm gonna take a shower and go back outside.

00:32:16,485 --> 00:32:19,345 [Chi]
Mm.

00:32:19,345 --> 00:32:23,585 [Chi]
Um, yeah. And I talked about the clothing, uh, management,

00:32:23,585 --> 00:32:47,745 [Chi]
content management, clothing content, dev work. Yeah, maybe and like animation, creative stuff. Like, again, I wanna do s- I wanna live in my life and I wanna do stuff, but it'd be really cool if I could just sit down for a little bit and learn some animation, partake into 2D animation. You know, lovely stuff, right? Uh, for just, even my, for my personal love, you know. All right. Cheers. Uh, content and girls. Yeah.
