# Deceptive Dinos

Deceptive Dinos is a Blooket gamemode released on May 9th, 2022 during Season 3 along with the Dino Box. It is very similar to Crypto Hack, where you either try to excavate as many fossils and also cheat, or you could investigate and scan other players to try and see if the person cheated to excavate better fossils. When you answer a question right, you get to choose between to either excavate or to investigate. If you choose to excavate, you will have four options, and 3 of them are rocks which either have a random fossil or a multiplier inside them (Similarly Gold Quest and Santa's Workshop but with rocks), and the last button is the Cheat button. This button lets you cheat once and see all the fossils/multipliers inside all 3 of the rocks. However, if you get caught cheating, you'll lose a large amount of your fossils.

If you choose to investigate, it will give you a full list of players in the game. You may choose one of them to investigate. After you click the person you want to investigate, it takes about 3 seconds to show you if the player is cheating or not. If they are cheating, it will say "CHEATER" and you will get lots of the cheater's fossils, but if they aren't cheating, then it will say "CLEAR" and you will not get anything from it (wasted question).

## Trivia

* The format of Deceptive Dinos is similar to Crypto Hack, Gold Quest, Candy Quest, Shamrock Quest and Santa's Workshop.
* Unlike those game modes, there is no "Nothing" ability, nor an ability that doubles or triples your current amount in Deceptive Dinos, as well as taking how many percent of fossils from players. There are, however, fossil income multipliers.
* The game mode title has a Dino Egg Blook on the letter O.
* The soundtrack for this game mode is actually a heavily altered version of the Jurassic Park/World theme in the ending part.
* The symbol for the currency is a bone.
* This is currently the only game mode where players can 'Cheat'.
* The pack that is used for Deceptive Dinos is the Dino Pack, as the dinosaurs in the Dino Pack are the most related Blooks to the game mode.
* Similarly to Crypto Hack, the only way that you can lose items is if a player catches you cheating. There is no "lose 25%" or "lose 50%" like there is in Gold Quest/Candy Quest/Shamrock Quest.
* Multipliers can stack, though it is unknown how many times.
