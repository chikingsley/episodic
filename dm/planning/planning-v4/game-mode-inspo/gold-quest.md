'''Gold Quest''' is a Blooket [[Game Modes|gamemode]] that released on November 12, 2020, during [[Blooket Seasons|Season 2]]. The game centers on players trying to get to the top of the leaderboard, while having gold stolen from them by others. It has two reskins, [[Candy Quest]] and [[Shamrock Quest]].

==Gameplay==
[[File:GoldQuest.webp|thumb|Gameplay]]
All players start with 0 gold and try to work their way up the leaderboard by getting correct answers. Questions are set on a loop and the order is randomized. Not everyone gets the same question at the same time.

If someone gets an answer incorrect, they will be forced to wait 5 seconds to continue while all other players continue answering questions. If they answer correctly, they are required to pick from one of three chests. They could be:

'''+''x''''' gives the contestant ''x'' gold.

*'''Lose ''25% or 50''%:''' -''25% or 50''% amount of gold from the player's total amount of gold.
* '''''Double Gold:''''' Doubles the player's total amount of gold.
* '''''Triple Gold:''''' Triples the player' total amount of gold.
*'''SWAP!:''' Allows the player to swap their amount of gold with another player's gold. This can either be really good if the player is near the bottom of the leaderboard or bad if they're near or at the top of the leaderboard.
*'''Steal ''10''% ''or'' ''25%'':''' Allows the player to steal either 10% or 25% of another player's gold.
*'''Nothing:''' It does absolutely nothing.

The host can set the game to play for a custom amount of time, and players continue adding, losing, multiplying, swapping and stealing their way to the top.

Many games can end with players having trillions to even quadrillions of gold.

== Trivia ==

* The [[Witch]] and [[Queen]] are the only [[Blooks]] from the [[Medieval Pack]] that don't appear in Gold Quest.
* [[Candy Quest]] temporarily replace Gold Quest during [[Spooktober]].
* [[Shamrock Quest]] temporarily replaces Gold Quest during the [[St Patrick's Day Event]].
* This [[Gamemodes|gamemode]] was based off of Candy Rush.
** This is because Candy Rush was the CoC gamemodes for 2019-2020, however it was retired and soon turned into Gold Quest.
