# Gold Quest

Gold Quest is a Blooket gamemode that released on November 12, 2020, during Season 2. The game centers on players trying to get to the top of the leaderboard, while having gold stolen from them by others. It has two reskins, Candy Quest and Shamrock Quest.

## Gameplay

All players start with 0 gold and try to work their way up the leaderboard by getting correct answers. Questions are set on a loop and the order is randomized. Not everyone gets the same question at the same time.

If someone gets an answer incorrect, they will be forced to wait 5 seconds to continue while all other players continue answering questions. If they answer correctly, they are required to pick from one of three chests. They could be:

* Add gold (e.g., +10, +20, +30, +40, +50, +100 Gold)
* Lose 25% or 50% of gold
* Double Gold
* Triple Gold
* SWAP!: Allows the player to swap their amount of gold with another player's gold.
* Steal 10% or 25% of another player's gold.
* Nothing

The host can set the game to play for a custom amount of time, and players continue adding, losing, multiplying, swapping and stealing their way to the top.

Many games can end with players having trillions to even quadrillions of gold.
