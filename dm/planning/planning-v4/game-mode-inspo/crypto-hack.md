'''Crypto Hack''' was released on May 18th, 2021 during [[Blooket Seasons|Season]] 2 and can only be played by hosting. The point is to answer questions while stealing Crypto from other players. It is similar to [[Gold Quest]]/[[Candy Quest]], [[Shamrock Quest]], [[Santa's Workshop|Santa’s Workshop]] and [[Deceptive Dinos]], but it doesn’t  include swapping or losing your Crypto. You need to answer questions correctly to obtain Crypto, or to hack others by guessing their password to steal their Crypto. All [[Bot Pack]] [[Blooks]] are in Crypto Hack, including Owl ([[Owl|Judgemental Owl]]), Toucan ([[Crazy Kingdom|Tax Toucan]]) and [[Spooky Ghost]] as a password select.

At the start of the game, you will get a choice of five different passwords. After choosing, you can start answering questions. If you get a question correct, then you will get a choice of three random outputs that are hidden, but if you get a question incorrect, then nothing happens, and you move on to the next question.

== Hacking Games/Tasks ==
There are also 8 different challenges that players have to complete after being hacked, but you get chosen to do a random one. 

The challenges include:  

* Making everything the same color
* Repeating a pattern
* Uploading & setting the temperature
* Reordering colors/shapes
* Tapping numbers 1-10
* Matching all buttons
* Matching cards
* Pressing 12 buttons

They are given randomly and there is no order in which you can receive challenges after being hacked.

All of the challenges are from Among Us.

=== Uploading Task ===
The first "task" is that you have to press "Start Upload" and then wait for it to finish uploading.

=== Repeat the Pattern Task ===
The second task will give you a 3 by 3 group of squares and and they will darken in a pattern. You must memorize the pattern to finish the task. When it's done, it will ask you to repeat the pattern and you must finish this before you can continue playing.

=== Setting the Temperature Task ===
The third task is to change the temperature. It will give you a number with arrows on either side and tell you to set that number to a different number reducing or increasing it by one with either of the arrows. Left for down, right for up.

=== Reordering the Right Colors Task ===
The fourth task is kind of like matching, but you just have to switch some shapes to get them to line up with each other. Select one and select another to switch their place and try to make each color and shape line up with the other, until all are matched up.

=== Numerical Task ===
The fifth task gives you numbers 1 through 10 shuffled around, and tells you to tap them in numerical order from 1 and going to 10.

=== Matching All Buttons Task ===
The sixth task gives you the same shapes you've seen in the aforementioned fourth task and tells you to make them all the same shape/color. Tapping on a shape will make the shape and color change, your goal is to make them all the same shape and color.

=== Matching Cards Task ===
The seventh task is literally a matching game using the Bot Blooks. Clicking on a card makes it flip over and when they have been matched with the other Bot of the same appearance they will stay facing up. One needs to match all of them to continue the game.

=== 12 Buttons Task ===
The eighth task tells you to click 12 numbers, and then gives you a rectangle full of squares in a 2 by 6 format and you will appear and you have to click them making them disappear. After one has been clicked another will appear in its place some time later and your goal is to click 12 of them. As you click the number 12 will go down proportionately with the number you have clicked, telling you how many you have left to click.

== Strategy ==
Since this [[Game Modes|Game Mode]] is heavily reliant on luck, speed, and insight, the "best" strategy would be to remember '''everything'''.

Remember all possible options for someone's password, and if you fail and get the opportunity to hack again, it will show the right password for the second time.

== Trivia ==

* The Crypto currency is most likely inspired from Bitcoin, which uses crypto to and the same symbol to each other too.
* Unlike [[Gold Quest]] or [[Candy Quest]], there’s no option to lose your crypto by a percentage. You lose crypto when your opponent guesses your password successfully and takes your crypto.
** There is also no option to swap crypto.
* All tasks except the last 2 are from the popular game, Among Us.
* [[Toucan]], [[Owl]] and [[Spooky Ghost]] are the only non [[Bot Pack]] [[Blooks]] in the game (But as a password select).
* This is the only [[Game Modes|Game Mod]]<nowiki/>[[Game Modes|e]] with an introduction, where it welcome players to the Terminal Hacking Portal to select a password before we get to play the quiz.
* [[Watson]] is the only [[Bot Pack|Bot Pa]]<nowiki/>[[Bot Pack|ck]] [[Bot Pack|Blook]] that gives you 0 crypto.
* The currency in this [[Game Modes|game]]<nowiki/>[[Game Modes|mode]] is quite identical to [[Tokens and XP|Blooket tokens]] from the [[Market]].
* The music that plays duri<nowiki/>ng this game mode is "[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWoLabGioRY The Spacex Cyberpunk]" by Yuri Petrovski.
* This is currently the onl<nowiki/>y pack that mentions a mystical, which is [[Spooky Ghost]].
* Crypto Hack is one of the<nowiki/> 6 [[Game Modes|game modes]] that have at least 1 [[Mysticals|Mystical]] [[Blook]] which is Spooky Ghost. The others are [[Tower Defense]], [[Santa's Workshop]], Halloween version [[Monster Brawl]], [[Fishing Frenzy]] and [[Cafe]].
* The password "TheCakeIsAL<nowiki/>ie" is a reference to a [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygBD45I-vk&t=5s YouTube video] created by [https://www.youtube.com/@SMG4 SMG4], a YouTuber who makes YTPs.
* 10 seconds are used up in the loading screen when you start the game, so if your game is 7 minutes long, players will only get 6 minutes and 50 seconds to play.
