00:00:00,219 --> 00:00:02,299 [Speaker 0]
... words in English ending in E-N-T and

00:00:02,339 --> 00:00:07,119 [Speaker 0]
A-N-T come from French. They're the

00:00:07,159 --> 00:00:09,719 [Speaker 0]
same. Same spelling, same meaning.

00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:14,039 [Speaker 0]
Pronounced ung. E-N-T and A-N-T is

00:00:14,059 --> 00:00:16,480 [Speaker 0]
pronounced ung. Like different would be...

00:00:17,859 --> 00:00:18,359 [Speaker 1]
Différent.

00:00:18,579 --> 00:00:21,659 [Speaker 0]
Différent. Yes. Mm-hmm. Important would

00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:23,139 [Speaker 0]
be? Impor-

00:00:23,659 --> 00:00:24,360 [Speaker 2]
Important.

00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:26,260 [Speaker 0]
Important. Yes. Mm-hmm.

00:00:26,539 --> 00:00:27,199 [Speaker 1]
Important.

00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:28,079 [Speaker 0]
Important.

00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:28,180 [Speaker 1]
Ah.

00:00:28,219 --> 00:00:30,460 [Speaker 0]
Yes. The I-N and I-M is pronounced ung.

00:00:30,959 --> 00:00:33,799 [Speaker 0]
Important. Yes. And the accent, the

00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,659 [Speaker 0]
accent, the stress, is always softly at

00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,340 [Speaker 0]
the end of a word in French. Always put it

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,499 [Speaker 0]
at the end. Yes.

00:00:40,499 --> 00:00:41,119 [Speaker 1]
[laughs] Hmm.

00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,900 [Speaker 0]
It may often be the diff- make, make the

00:00:43,939 --> 00:00:45,799 [Speaker 0]
difference between being understood or not

00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,020 [Speaker 0]
being understood, depending on putting

00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,860 [Speaker 0]
the accent at the end. The stress at the

00:00:51,879 --> 00:00:56,700 [Speaker 0]
end of a word. So, uh, um, it is not very

00:00:56,759 --> 00:00:58,299 [Speaker 0]
different that way would be?

00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,799 [Speaker 1]
Ce n'est différent.

00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:03,799 [Speaker 0]
It is... No- no- don't rush it. Think it

00:01:03,839 --> 00:01:05,239 [Speaker 0]
out. It is not...

00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:06,379 [Speaker 1]
Ce n'est pas.

00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:10,779 [Speaker 0]
Right. [laughs] You see? So again, it is

00:01:10,819 --> 00:01:12,219 [Speaker 0]
not very different.

00:01:12,899 --> 00:01:13,500 [Speaker 1]
Ce n'est pas.

00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:14,759 [Speaker 0]
Very different.

00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:16,759 [Speaker 1]
Très différent.

00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:17,720 [Speaker 0]
Like that.

00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:19,519 [Speaker 1]
Comme ça.

00:01:19,779 --> 00:01:20,199 [Speaker 0]
Right.

00:01:20,199 --> 00:01:21,079 [Speaker 1]
[laughs]

00:01:21,099 --> 00:01:23,320 [Speaker 0]
Ce n'est pas très différent comme ça.

00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,839 [Speaker 0]
Mm-hmm. Yes. But it is very important for

00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:28,179 [Speaker 0]
me.

00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:34,480 [Speaker 2]
Mais c'est très important pour moi.

00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:36,499 [Speaker 0]
Right. Mais, but,

00:01:37,139 --> 00:01:39,999 [Speaker 0]
c'est très, it is very, important,

00:01:40,199 --> 00:01:43,379 [Speaker 0]
important, pour moi. Mm-hmm. Yes.

00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:49,639 [Speaker 0]
Très is spelled T-R-É-S. Yes. The, uh,

00:01:50,779 --> 00:01:55,379 [Speaker 0]
the S at the end of a word may be pushed

00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:56,459 [Speaker 0]
over to the

00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,299 [Speaker 0]
following word if the following word

00:01:58,299 --> 00:02:01,319 [Speaker 0]
starts with a vowel, and it takes on the

00:02:01,339 --> 00:02:05,539 [Speaker 0]
sound of a, of a zed, of a Z. Yes. For

00:02:05,559 --> 00:02:07,339 [Speaker 0]
instance, very important can be

00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:11,039 [Speaker 0]
très important. Yes. But the-

00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:11,479 [Speaker 1]
[laughs]

00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:14,379 [Speaker 0]
... the S belongs, is hooked onto

00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:17,059 [Speaker 0]
important, to the vowel. Tr- In slow

00:02:17,119 --> 00:02:21,219 [Speaker 0]
motion it is très important. So it's not

00:02:21,299 --> 00:02:21,759 [Speaker 0]
très.

00:02:22,139 --> 00:02:22,179 [Speaker 2]
Right.

00:02:22,179 --> 00:02:25,239 [Speaker 0]
But très important. C'est très important.

00:02:25,339 --> 00:02:25,619 [Speaker 0]
Yes.

00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:26,559 [Speaker 2]
Très important.

00:02:26,559 --> 00:02:29,199 [Speaker 0]
If you cut, then there's no push. If you

00:02:29,259 --> 00:02:31,359 [Speaker 0]
cut off the très you say, "C'est très

00:02:32,699 --> 00:02:34,839 [Speaker 0]
important." Yes. Or, "C'est très

00:02:34,899 --> 00:02:35,639 [Speaker 0]
important."

00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:37,099 [Speaker 1]
[laughs]

00:02:37,119 --> 00:02:38,239 [Speaker 0]
Evident would be?

00:02:40,679 --> 00:02:41,339 [Speaker 2]
Évident.

00:02:41,559 --> 00:02:44,139 [Speaker 0]
Évident. Yes. Recent would be?

00:02:45,739 --> 00:02:46,359 [Speaker 1]
Récent.

00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:50,339 [Speaker 0]
Récent. Yes. Mm-hmm. Yes. Constant?

00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:51,879 [Speaker 1]
Constant.

00:02:52,099 --> 00:02:56,779 [Speaker 0]
Constant. Yes. Mm-hmm. Yes. And words in

00:02:56,799 --> 00:03:01,219 [Speaker 0]
English ending in ary, everything in ary,

00:03:01,559 --> 00:03:03,379 [Speaker 0]
like necessary, contrary-

00:03:03,379 --> 00:03:03,399 [Speaker 1]
[clears throat]

00:03:03,399 --> 00:03:05,079 [Speaker 0]
... military, everything ary-

00:03:05,079 --> 00:03:05,779 [Speaker 1]
[clears throat]

00:03:05,779 --> 00:03:10,819 [Speaker 0]
... ary goes up into the air. Yes. So

00:03:10,839 --> 00:03:14,319 [Speaker 0]
instead of in the spelling A-R-Y, it's

00:03:14,399 --> 00:03:17,639 [Speaker 0]
spelled A-I-R-E. So necessary would

00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:17,979 [Speaker 0]
be?

00:03:18,839 --> 00:03:19,819 [Speaker 2]
Nécessaire.

00:03:19,899 --> 00:03:22,319 [Speaker 0]
Nécessaire. Nécessaire.

00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:22,339 [Speaker 2]

00:03:22,459 --> 00:03:22,779 [Speaker 0]
Yes.

00:03:22,779 --> 00:03:23,359 [Speaker 2]
[laughs]

00:03:23,359 --> 00:03:26,319 [Speaker 0]
So, um, it is not necessary for me.

00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:29,739 [Speaker 2]
Ce n'est pas nécessaire

00:03:30,459 --> 00:03:30,899 [Speaker 2]
pour moi.

00:03:30,979 --> 00:03:32,959 [Speaker 0]
Right. Ce n'est pas nécessaire pour moi.

00:03:33,059 --> 00:03:35,599 [Speaker 0]
Yes. Mm-hmm. Contrary?

00:03:36,939 --> 00:03:37,839 [Speaker 1]
Contraire.

00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:41,039 [Speaker 0]
Contraire. Yes. You may hear French people

00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:42,459 [Speaker 0]
say, "Au contraire."

00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:42,739 [Speaker 2]
Mm-hmm.

00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:43,999 [Speaker 0]
They like to say that.

00:03:43,999 --> 00:03:44,139 [Speaker 1]
[laughs]

00:03:44,139 --> 00:03:44,139 [Speaker 2]

00:03:44,139 --> 00:03:47,579 [Speaker 0]

so-

00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:08,939 [Speaker 2]
Mm-hmm

00:04:08,939 --> 00:04:12,099 [Speaker 0]
... visualize the spelling. Mentally. Yes.

00:04:13,139 --> 00:04:15,799 [Speaker 0]

again, to come is... Like, to come, what

00:07:28,577 --> 00:07:29,597 [Speaker 0]
you find on the wood.

00:07:30,678 --> 00:07:31,178 [Speaker 3]
Venir.

00:07:31,397 --> 00:07:34,397 [Speaker 0]
Right. So, will you come with me?

00:07:38,577 --> 00:07:40,537 [Speaker 3]
Voulez venir, venir.

00:07:41,617 --> 00:07:45,917 [Speaker 0]
I want you always to think it out and to

00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:50,758 [Speaker 0]
take your time, so don't rush it. Will you

00:07:50,797 --> 00:07:51,377 [Speaker 0]
would be?

00:07:52,697 --> 00:07:53,357 [Speaker 3]
Voulez-vous.

00:07:53,537 --> 00:07:57,678 [Speaker 0]
Right. Voulez-vous, come.

00:07:58,958 --> 00:07:59,617 [Speaker 3]
Voulez-vous.

00:08:00,178 --> 00:08:00,537 [Speaker 0]
Mm-hmm.

00:08:02,477 --> 00:08:02,937 [Speaker 3]
Venir.

00:08:03,077 --> 00:08:04,277 [Speaker 0]
Right. With me.

00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:05,277 [Speaker 3]
Avec moi.

00:08:05,337 --> 00:08:09,017 [Speaker 0]
Right. Voulez-vous venir avec moi? Yes.

00:08:09,937 --> 00:08:12,077 [Speaker 0]
How would you say, "Will you come eat with

00:08:12,157 --> 00:08:12,357 [Speaker 0]
me?"

00:08:14,057 --> 00:08:14,958 [Speaker 3]
Voulez-vous manger-

00:08:14,977 --> 00:08:18,237 [Speaker 0]
Come. Not so fast because I want you to

00:08:18,277 --> 00:08:24,958 [Speaker 0]
think it out, step by step, slowly. So

00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:28,078 [Speaker 0]
again, will you come eat with me?

00:08:29,178 --> 00:08:29,817 [Speaker 3]
Voulez-vous.

00:08:30,017 --> 00:08:30,357 [Speaker 0]

00:08:31,917 --> 00:08:32,297 [Speaker 0]
Eat.

00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:33,497 [Speaker 3]
Manger.

00:08:33,577 --> 00:08:34,057 [Speaker 0]
With me.

00:08:34,357 --> 00:08:34,997 [Speaker 3]
Avec moi.

00:08:35,017 --> 00:08:38,037 [Speaker 0]
Right. That's what I want you to do. Yes.

00:08:38,398 --> 00:08:38,737 [Speaker 0]
Mm-hmm.
