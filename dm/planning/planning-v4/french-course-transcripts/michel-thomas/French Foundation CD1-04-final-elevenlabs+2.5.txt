00:00:00,219 --> 00:00:02,299
Teacher (Speaker 0): ... words in English ending in E-N-T and

00:00:02,339 --> 00:00:07,119
Teacher (Speaker 0): A-N-T come from French. They're the

00:00:07,159 --> 00:00:09,719
Teacher (Speaker 0): same. Same spelling, same meaning.

00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:14,039
Teacher (Speaker 0): Pronounced AN (French nasal 'an' [ɑ̃]). E-N-T and A-N-T is

00:00:14,059 --> 00:00:16,480
Teacher (Speaker 0): pronounced AN. Like different would be...

00:00:17,859 --> 00:00:18,359
Student 1 (Speaker 1): Différent.

00:00:18,579 --> 00:00:21,659
Teacher (Speaker 0): Différent. Yes. Mm-hmm. Important would

00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:23,139
Teacher (Speaker 0): be? Impor-

00:00:23,659 --> 00:00:24,360
Student 2 (Speaker 2): Important.

00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:26,260
Teacher (Speaker 0): Important. Yes. Mm-hmm.

00:00:26,539 --> 00:00:27,199
Student 1 (Speaker 1): Important.

00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:28,079
Teacher (Speaker 0): Important.

00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:28,180
Student 1 (Speaker 1): Ah.

00:00:28,219 --> 00:00:30,460
Teacher (Speaker 0): Yes. The I-N and I-M is pronounced AN (French nasal 'an' [ɛ̃] or [ɑ̃], here typically [ɛ̃] for important).

00:00:30,959 --> 00:00:33,799
Teacher (Speaker 0): Important. Yes. And the accent, the

00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,659
Teacher (Speaker 0): accent, the stress, is always softly at

00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,340
Teacher (Speaker 0): the end of a word in French. Always put it

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,499
Teacher (Speaker 0): at the end. Yes.

00:00:40,499 --> 00:00:41,119
Student 1 (Speaker 1): [laughs] Hmm.

00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,900
Teacher (Speaker 0): It may often make the difference between being understood or not

00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,020
Teacher (Speaker 0): being understood, depending on putting

00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,860
Teacher (Speaker 0): the accent at the end. The stress at the

00:00:51,879 --> 00:00:56,700
Teacher (Speaker 0): end of a word. So, it is not very

00:00:56,759 --> 00:00:58,299
Teacher (Speaker 0): different that way would be?

00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,799
Student 1 (Speaker 1): Ce n'est différent. (Missing "pas" and "très")

00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:03,799
Teacher (Speaker 0): It is... No- no- don't rush it. Think it

00:01:03,839 --> 00:01:05,239
Teacher (Speaker 0): out. It is not...

00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:06,379
Student 1 (Speaker 1): Ce n'est pas.

00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:10,779
Teacher (Speaker 0): Right. [laughs] You see? So again, it is

00:01:10,819 --> 00:01:12,219
Teacher (Speaker 0): not very different.

00:01:12,899 --> 00:01:13,500
Student 1 (Speaker 1): Ce n'est pas.

00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:14,759
Teacher (Speaker 0): Very different.

00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:16,759
Student 1 (Speaker 1): Très différent.

00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:17,720
Teacher (Speaker 0): Like that.

00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:19,519
Student 1 (Speaker 1): Comme ça.

00:01:19,779 --> 00:01:20,199
Teacher (Speaker 0): Right.

00:01:20,199 --> 00:01:21,079
Student 1 (Speaker 1): [laughs]

00:01:21,099 --> 00:01:23,320
Teacher (Speaker 0) (Confirming student): Ce n'est pas très différent comme ça.

00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,839
Teacher (Speaker 0): Mm-hmm. Yes. But it is very important for

00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:28,179
Teacher (Speaker 0): me.

00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:34,480
Student 2 (Speaker 2): Mais c'est très important pour moi.

00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:36,499
Teacher (Speaker 0): Right. Mais, but,

00:01:37,139 --> 00:01:39,999
Teacher (Speaker 0): c'est très, it is very, important,

00:01:40,199 --> 00:01:43,379
Teacher (Speaker 0): important, pour moi. Mm-hmm. Yes.

00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:49,639
Teacher (Speaker 0): Très is spelled T-R-É-S. Yes. The,

00:01:50,779 --> 00:01:55,379
Teacher (Speaker 0): the S at the end of a word may be pushed

00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:56,459
Teacher (Speaker 0): over to the

00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,299
Teacher (Speaker 0): following word if the following word

00:01:58,299 --> 00:02:01,319
Teacher (Speaker 0): starts with a vowel, and it takes on the

00:02:01,339 --> 00:02:05,539
Teacher (Speaker 0): sound of a, of a Z. Yes. For

00:02:05,559 --> 00:02:07,339
Teacher (Speaker 0): instance, very important can be

00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:11,039
Teacher (Speaker 0): très important (pronounced "trèZimportant" due to liaison). Yes. But the-

00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:11,479
Student 1 (Speaker 1): [laughs]

00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:14,379
Teacher (Speaker 0): ... the S belongs, is hooked onto

00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:17,059
Teacher (Speaker 0): important, to the vowel. In slow

00:02:17,119 --> 00:02:21,219
Teacher (Speaker 0): motion it is très (pause) important. So it's not

00:02:21,299 --> 00:02:21,759
Teacher (Speaker 0): très.

00:02:22,139 --> 00:02:22,179
Student 2 (Speaker 2): Right.

00:02:22,179 --> 00:02:25,239
Teacher (Speaker 0): But très important. C'est très important (with liaison).

00:02:25,339 --> 00:02:25,619
Teacher (Speaker 0): Yes.

00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:26,559
Student 2 (Speaker 2): Très important.

00:02:26,559 --> 00:02:29,199
Teacher (Speaker 0): If you cut, then there's no push (no liaison). If you

00:02:29,259 --> 00:02:31,359
Teacher (Speaker 0): cut after très you say, "C'est très

00:02:32,699 --> 00:02:34,839
Teacher (Speaker 0): (pause) important." Yes. Or, "C'est très

00:02:34,899 --> 00:02:35,639
Teacher (Speaker 0): important (with liaison)."

00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:37,099
Student 1 (Speaker 1): [laughs]

00:02:37,119 --> 00:02:38,239
Teacher (Speaker 0): Evident would be?

00:02:40,679 --> 00:02:41,339
Student 2 (Speaker 2): Évident.

00:02:41,559 --> 00:02:44,139
Teacher (Speaker 0): Évident. Yes. Recent would be?

00:02:45,739 --> 00:02:46,359
Student 1 (Speaker 1): Récent.

00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:50,339
Teacher (Speaker 0): Récent. Yes. Mm-hmm. Yes. Constant?

00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:51,879
Student 1 (Speaker 1): Constant.

00:02:52,099 --> 00:02:56,779
Teacher (Speaker 0): Constant. Yes. Mm-hmm. Yes. And words in

00:02:56,799 --> 00:03:01,219
Teacher (Speaker 0): English ending in ARY, everything in ARY,

00:03:01,559 --> 00:03:03,379

Student 1 (Speaker 1): [clears throat]

00:03:05,779 --> 00:03:10,819
Teacher (Speaker 0): ... ARY goes up into AIRE. Yes. So

00:03:10,839 --> 00:03:14,319
Teacher (Speaker 0): instead of in the spelling A-R-Y, it's

00:03:14,399 --> 00:03:17,639
Teacher (Speaker 0): spelled A-I-R-E. So necessary would

00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:17,979
Teacher (Speaker 0): be?

00:03:18,839 --> 00:03:19,819

Student 2 (Speaker 2): [laughs]

00:03:23,359 --> 00:03:26,319
Teacher (Speaker 0): So, it is not necessary for me.

00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:29,739
Student 2 (Speaker 2): Ce n'est pas nécessaire

00:03:30,459 --> 00:03:30,899
