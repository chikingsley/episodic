You're just about to experience a new and different approach to learning and to language learning that will give you the practical and functional use within 10 to 12
hours of learning time.

00:37.880-01:02.420
All this is achieved and will be achieved without memorizing, which means there's never anything to memorize without learning by rote, without drill, without
textbooks, without taking notes, and without homework, without any mental homework.

01:03.820-01:10.100
Before starting, I have to set up two ground rules, two very important ground rules.

01:10.500-01:34.320
First, it is very important for you to be relaxed, to take off, to leave off any form of tension, any form of anxiety that is usually associated with learning and
traditionally also particularly with language learning.

01:34.320-01:43.160
And any form of anxiety, any form of tension inhibits true and effective learning.

01:43.160-01:49.540
Before starting, there are two ground rules that are very important.

01:50.540-02:01.680
The first ground rules for you never to worry about remembering and therefore never to try to remember.

02:01.680-02:12.540
Because this is a method for the responsibility for your remembering is in the teaching and not with you, not with the learner.

02:12.540-02:30.720
Therefore, there is no homework, not even any mental homework.

02:30.720-02:38.860
It's very important not to review even mentally of what you've learned.

02:38.860-02:46.440
Let it be absorbed and internalized to become knowledge.

02:46.440-02:50.560
And what you know, you will not forget.

02:50.560-02:57.280
Now come to ground rule number two that is very important too.

02:57.280-03:10.100
That ground rule is that in the course, I'm using two students as a teaching device in order to create a learning situation for three.

03:10.100-03:17.100
You will become the third in the group.

03:17.100-03:19.940
And very quickly, you will associate with the two on the tapes.

03:19.940-03:22.080
You will become part of it.

03:22.080-03:39.440
And it's very important, therefore, that after I introduce a concept, I will follow up in a practical way and show you how to formulate and to express thoughts.

03:39.440-03:46.780
First, those will be short sentences.

03:46.780-03:50.780
Then more and more complex and longer sentences.

03:50.780-03:53.780
And whenever I say, "How do you say it?"

03:53.780-04:09.420
At that point, it's very important, I repeat, very important for you to use the pause button on the machine, which gives you time to think it out, to think it through, and
to respond.

04:09.420-04:16.760
After you respond, you release the pause button.

04:16.760-04:21.100
You will then get the response from one of the two students.

04:21.100-04:28.100
And after that, I will repeat it so that the last impression is always what you get from me.

04:28.100-04:44.180
And this is how you will experience a constant sense of progression, a constant sense of learning that you will find exciting, stimulating, and self-rewarding.

04:44.180-04:47.520
Thank you.

04:47.520-04:47.760
Thank you.

04:47.760-05:17.740
Thank you.
