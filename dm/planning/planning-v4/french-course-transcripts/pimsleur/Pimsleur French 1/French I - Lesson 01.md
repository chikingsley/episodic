This is Unit 1 of Pimsleur's French 1. Listen to this French conversation.

00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:08,720 [Speaker 1]
Pardon? Est-ce que vous comprenez l'anglais?

00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,679 [Speaker 2]
Non, monsieur, je ne comprends pas l'anglais.

00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:15,099 [Speaker 1]
Je comprends un peu le français.

00:00:15,099 --> 00:00:17,219 [Speaker 2]
Est-ce que vous êtes americain?

00:00:17,219 --> 00:00:18,819 [Speaker 1]
Oui, mademoiselle.

00:00:18,819 --> 00:00:32,500 [Speaker 0]
In the next few minutes, you'll learn not only to understand this conversation, but to take part in it yourself. Imagine an American man sitting next to a Frenchwoman. He wants to begin a conversation so he says, "Excuse me?"

00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,739 [Speaker 1]
Pardon?

00:00:33,739 --> 00:00:47,379 [Speaker 0]
The French speaker is going to repeat this word part by part, starting from the end. You are to repeat each part after him, trying to make your pronunciation sound exactly like his. Be sure you repeat aloud.

00:00:47,379 --> 00:00:49,879 [Speaker 1]
Don?

00:00:49,879 --> 00:00:50,680 [Speaker 1]
Don?

00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:50,700 [Speaker 1]
Par.

00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:51,000 [Speaker 0]
How do you say, "Excuse me?" in French?

00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:50,700 [Speaker 1]
Par.

00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:50,700 [Speaker 1]
Pardon?

00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:50,700 [Speaker 1]
Pardon?

00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:51,119 [Speaker 1]
Pardon?

00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:51,979 [Speaker 0]
Now, he wants to ask her if she understands English. First the word English. Listen and repeat.

00:00:51,979 --> 00:01:01,979 [Speaker 1]
L'anglais. L'anglais.

00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:12,679 [Speaker 0]
How do you say English? L'anglais. Now, say the same word leaving off the L- sound at the beginning.

00:01:12,679 --> 00:01:22,679 [Speaker 1]
Anglais. Anglais.

00:01:22,679 --> 00:01:32,679 [Speaker 0]
Now, again with the L- sound.

00:01:32,679 --> 00:01:42,679 [Speaker 1]
L'anglais. L'anglais.

00:01:42,679 --> 00:02:12,679 [Speaker 0]
The difference is that when the L sound is off, you're saying English, and when it's on, you're saying the English. Most of the time the L sound will be there in French, even when the word the is not there in our language. Once again, say English.

00:02:12,679 --> 00:02:15,939 [Speaker 1]

Pardon?

00:02:25,939 --> 00:02:32,979 [Speaker 0]
You should repeat after the speaker gives the right response, trying to make your pronunciation sound like his.

00:02:32,979 --> 00:02:35,199 [Speaker 1]
Pardon?

00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:39,279 [Speaker 0]

00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,379 [Speaker 0]
Say, "Understand."

00:03:23,379 --> 00:03:26,999 [Speaker 1]

Est-ce que.

00:04:45,499 --> 00:04:55,519 [Speaker 0]

Vous comprenez.

00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:05,599 [Speaker 0]
And now try to ask, "Do you understand?"

00:05:05,599 --> 00:05:10,659 [Speaker 1]
Est-ce que vous comprenez?

00:05:10,659 --> 00:05:15,799 [Speaker 1]
Est-ce que vous comprenez?

00:05:15,799 --> 00:05:19,419 [Speaker 0]

Est-ce que vous comprenez l'anglais?

00:05:44,359 --> 00:05:50,199 [Speaker 1]
Est-ce que vous comprenez l'anglais?

00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:54,319 [Speaker 0]
The woman answers, "No." Listen and repeat.

00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:56,739 [Speaker 2]
Non.

00:05:56,739 --> 00:05:59,139 [Speaker 2]

00:05:59,139 --> 00:05:59,459 [Speaker 2]
Non.

00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:04,299 [Speaker 0]
"No, sir." Listen and repeat.

00:06:04,299 --> 00:06:07,769 [Speaker 2]
Non, monsieur.

00:06:07,769 --> 00:06:10,589 [Speaker 1]
Sieur.

00:06:10,589 --> 00:06:14,170 [Speaker 1]

Monsieur.

00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:29,889 [Speaker 0]
How do you say sir or mister?

00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:32,969 [Speaker 1]
Monsieur.

00:06:32,969 --> 00:06:36,769 [Speaker 0]
Say, no sir.

00:06:36,769 --> 00:06:40,050 [Speaker 2]
Non, monsieur.

00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:45,909 [Speaker 0]
How would you ask someone if he understands?

00:06:45,909 --> 00:06:50,870 [Speaker 1]
Est-ce que vous comprenez?

00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:55,769 [Speaker 1]
Est-ce que vous comprenez?

00:06:55,769 --> 00:07:01,149 [Speaker 0]

Est-ce que vous comprenez l'anglais?

00:07:06,729 --> 00:07:12,349 [Speaker 1]
Est-ce que vous comprenez l'anglais?

00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:19,270 [Speaker 0]
The man says, I understand. First, the word I alone. Listen and repeat.

00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:22,270 [Speaker 1]
Je.

00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:25,190 [Speaker 1]
Je.

00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:28,029 [Speaker 1]
Je.

00:07:28,029 --> 00:07:31,590 [Speaker 0]
And now the word understand.

00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:34,629 [Speaker 1]
Comprends.

00:07:34,629 --> 00:07:37,550 [Speaker 1]
Prends.

00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:40,389 [Speaker 1]

00:08:04,069 --> 00:08:07,690 [Speaker 1]

00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:13,589 [Speaker 0]
Try to say, I understand English.

00:08:13,589 --> 00:08:18,449 [Speaker 1]
Je comprends l'anglais.

00:08:18,449 --> 00:08:23,309 [Speaker 1]
Je comprends l'anglais.

00:08:23,309 --> 00:08:28,550 [Speaker 0]
Listen to the words, I understand and you understand, together.

00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:32,329 [Speaker 1]
Je comprends. Vous comprenez.

00:08:32,329 --> 00:08:35,990 [Speaker 1]
Je comprends. Vous comprenez.

00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:40,969 [Speaker 0]
Say, you understand.

00:08:40,969 --> 00:08:45,190 [Speaker 1]
Vous comprenez.

00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:49,949 [Speaker 0]
Say, I understand.

00:08:49,949 --> 00:08:53,569 [Speaker 1]
Je comprends.

00:08:53,569 --> 00:08:57,329 [Speaker 0]
Say, excuse me.

00:08:57,329 --> 00:09:00,289 [Speaker 1]
Pardon.

00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:05,869 [Speaker 0]
Ask, do you understand?

00:09:05,869 --> 00:09:10,929 [Speaker 1]
Est-ce que vous comprenez?

00:09:10,929 --> 00:09:18,609 [Speaker 0]
Ask the woman, "Do you understand English?"

00:09:18,609 --> 00:09:25,969 [Speaker 1]
Est-ce que vous comprenez l'anglais?

00:09:25,969 --> 00:09:33,069 [Speaker 1]
Est-ce que vous comprenez l'anglais?

00:09:33,069 --> 00:09:37,410 [Speaker 0]
How does she answer, "No, sir"?

00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:40,709 [Speaker 2]
Non, monsieur.

00:09:40,709 --> 00:09:44,149 [Speaker 2]
Non, monsieur.

00:09:44,149 --> 00:09:49,009 [Speaker 0]
How do you say, "I understand"?

00:09:49,009 --> 00:09:52,489 [Speaker 1]
Je comprends.

00:09:52,489 --> 00:09:55,389 [Speaker 1]
Comprends.

00:09:55,389 --> 00:10:00,270 [Speaker 0]
Now she wants to say, "I don't understand." Listen and repeat.

00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:04,229 [Speaker 1]
Je ne comprends pas.

00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:06,489 [Speaker 1]
Pas.

00:10:06,489 --> 00:10:08,809 [Speaker 1]
Pas.

00:10:08,809 --> 00:10:12,509 [Speaker 1]
Comprends pas.

00:10:12,509 --> 00:10:16,369 [Speaker 1]
Comprends pas.

00:10:16,369 --> 00:10:19,369 [Speaker 1]
Je ne.

00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:22,249 [Speaker 1]
Je ne.

00:10:22,249 --> 00:10:26,809 [Speaker 1]
Je ne comprends pas.

00:10:26,809 --> 00:10:31,209 [Speaker 1]
Je ne comprends pas.

00:10:31,209 --> 00:10:36,609 [Speaker 0]
Say, "I don't understand."

00:10:36,609 --> 00:10:40,190 [Speaker 1]
Je ne comprends pas.

00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:49,769 [Speaker 0]
Notice that there are two things that make this sentence negative. Mainly, it's the pas at the end, but also there's the 'ne' sound of-

00:10:49,769 --> 00:10:50,109 [Speaker 1]
Je ne

00:10:50,109 --> 00:10:52,549 [Speaker 0]
... listen again.

00:10:52,549 --> 00:10:54,329 [Speaker 1]
Je ne comprends pas.

00:10:54,329 --> 00:11:09,630 [Speaker 0]
There are lots of little sounds like that, that almost get thrown away in rapid speech. It's important to notice them, however, because they can often change the meaning of a sentence. Once again, say, "I don't understand."

00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:13,669 [Speaker 1]
Je ne comprends pas.

00:11:13,669 --> 00:11:17,149 [Speaker 0]
Say, "English."

00:11:17,149 --> 00:11:19,949 [Speaker 1]
L'anglais.

00:11:19,949 --> 00:11:26,309 [Speaker 0]
Say, "I don't understand English."

00:11:26,309 --> 00:11:31,749 [Speaker 1]
Je ne comprends pas l'anglais.

00:11:31,749 --> 00:11:37,190 [Speaker 1]
Je ne comprends pas l'anglais.

00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:42,269 [Speaker 0]
Ask, "Do you understand?"

00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:46,729 [Speaker 1]
Est-ce que vous comprenez?

00:11:46,729 --> 00:11:52,350 [Speaker 0]
Ask me if I understand English.

00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:57,549 [Speaker 1]
Est-ce que vous comprenez l'anglais?

00:11:57,549 --> 00:12:03,149 [Speaker 0]
Answer, "No, I don't understand."

00:12:03,149 --> 00:12:07,769 [Speaker 2]
Non, je ne comprends pas.

00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:12,089 [Speaker 2]
Non, je ne comprends pas.

00:12:12,089 --> 00:12:17,799 [Speaker 0]
I don't understand English.

00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:23,199 [Speaker 2]
Je ne comprends pas l'anglais.

00:12:23,199 --> 00:12:27,679 [Speaker 0]
Now, here is the name of the French language. Listen and repeat.

00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:31,119 [Speaker 1]
Le français.

00:12:31,119 --> 00:12:34,279 [Speaker 1]
Français.

00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:37,479 [Speaker 1]
Français.

00:12:37,479 --> 00:12:41,140 [Speaker 1]
Le français.

00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:44,800 [Speaker 1]
Le français.

00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:49,779 [Speaker 0]
Say, French. Meaning the French language.

00:12:49,779 --> 00:12:53,220 [Speaker 1]
Le français.

00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:57,299 [Speaker 0]
Say, I understand.

00:12:57,299 --> 00:13:00,479 [Speaker 1]
Je comprends.

00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:06,319 [Speaker 0]
Say, I understand French.

00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:11,319 [Speaker 1]
Je comprends le français.

00:13:11,319 --> 00:13:16,399 [Speaker 1]
Je comprends le français.

00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:25,059 [Speaker 0]
Listen carefully to that response again and notice how the L sound of "le français" almost gets lost, but not quite.

Oui, mademoiselle.

00:20:10,961 --> 00:20:18,001 [Speaker 0]
Ask the woman, do you understand English?

00:20:18,001 --> 00:20:24,421 [Speaker 1]
Est-ce que vous comprenez l'anglais?

00:20:24,421 --> 00:20:31,541 [Speaker 1]
Est-ce que vous comprenez l'anglais?

00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:37,141 [Speaker 0]

Je comprends un peu le français.

00:21:16,421 --> 00:21:23,841 [Speaker 0]
Now sit back and listen to a French conversation. The same one you heard at the beginning of this tape just a few minutes ago.

00:21:23,841 --> 00:21:26,421 [Speaker 1]
Pardon? Est-ce que vous comprenez l'anglais?

00:21:26,421 --> 00:21:29,441 [Speaker 2]
Non, monsieur, je ne comprends pas l'anglais.

Pardon? Est-ce que vous comprenez l'anglais?

00:21:40,481 --> 00:21:43,481 [Speaker 2]
Non, monsieur, je ne comprends pas l'anglais.

00:21:43,481 --> 00:21:45,481 [Speaker 1]
Je comprends un peu le français.

00:21:45,481 --> 00:21:47,662 [Speaker 2]
Est-ce que vous êtes américain?

00:21:47,662 --> 00:21:48,662 [Speaker 1]
Oui, mademoiselle.

00:21:48,662 --> 00:21:57,662 [Speaker 0]
Now imagine that you're the person sitting next to the French woman. You want to begin a conversation, so what do you say?

00:21:57,662 --> 00:22:01,141 [Speaker 1]
Pardon?

00:22:01,141 --> 00:22:04,141 [Speaker 1]
Pardon, mademoiselle.

00:22:04,141 --> 00:22:10,542 [Speaker 0]
She doesn't answer. So try asking her if she understands.

Est-ce que vous comprenez le français?

00:22:28,741 --> 00:22:35,901 [Speaker 1]
Est-ce que vous comprenez le français?

00:22:35,901 --> 00:22:40,901 [Speaker 0]
Still no answer. Now ask her if she understands English.

00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:45,902 [Speaker 1]
Est-ce que vous comprenez l'anglais?

00:22:45,902 --> 00:22:52,801 [Speaker 1]

Est-ce que vous comprenez le français, monsieur?

00:23:35,881 --> 00:23:41,801 [Speaker 0]
Tell her you understand a little.

00:23:41,801 --> 00:23:44,361 [Speaker 1]
Je comprends un peu.

00:23:44,361 --> 00:23:47,641 [Speaker 1]
Je comprends un peu.

00:23:47,641 --> 00:23:55,641 [Speaker 0]
She wants to ask you if you're American. How does she say it?

00:23:55,641 --> 00:24:00,041 [Speaker 2]
Est-ce que vous êtes américain?

00:24:00,041 --> 00:24:05,041 [Speaker 2]

Je comprends l'anglais.

00:24:34,391 --> 00:24:40,931 [Speaker 0]
She'll ask you another question. Answer it using the expression, "A little."

00:24:40,931 --> 00:24:43,771 [Speaker 2]
Est-ce que vous comprenez le français?

00:24:43,771 --> 00:24:47,851 [Speaker 2]

Pardon, mademoiselle.

00:25:08,852 --> 00:25:15,172 [Speaker 0]
She doesn't answer. Ask her if she understands.

Est-ce que vous comprenez?

00:25:20,031 --> 00:25:27,691 [Speaker 0]
Ask her if she understands French.

00:25:27,691 --> 00:25:34,031 [Speaker 1]
Est-ce que vous comprenez le français?

00:25:34,031 --> 00:25:41,671 [Speaker 0]
Still no answer. Now ask her if she understands English.

00:25:41,671 --> 00:25:47,631 [Speaker 1]
Est-ce que vous comprenez l'anglais?

00:25:47,631 --> 00:25:51,211 [Speaker 2]
Non, monsieur.

00:25:51,211 --> 00:25:59,052 [Speaker 0]
How does she tell you that she doesn't understand English?

00:25:59,052 --> 00:26:04,311 [Speaker 2]
Je ne comprends pas l'anglais.

00:26:04,311 --> 00:26:11,491 [Speaker 0]

00:26:33,152 --> 00:26:38,092 [Speaker 2]
Est-ce que vous êtes américain?

00:26:38,092 --> 00:26:42,012 [Speaker 0]

Je comprends un peu le français.

00:27:24,411 --> 00:27:48,232 [Speaker 0]
And that's true. Now you do understand French a little. Don't be concerned if you've not made every response correctly. All that you've learned here will be reviewed in future units. If you've mastered about 80% of the material in this lesson, you're ready to move onto the next. Otherwise, you should invest another 30 minutes in doing this unit over again.

00:27:48,232 --> 00:27:56,391 [Speaker 0]
This is the end of today's lesson. When you continue with the next unit tomorrow, please begin with track number two.
