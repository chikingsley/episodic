00:00:00,479 --> 00:00:05,039 [Speaker 0]
This is unit two of Pimsleur's French one. Listen to this conversation.

00:00:05,039 --> 00:00:08,539 [Speaker 1]
Pardon, Monsieur. Est-ce que vous comprenez le français?

00:00:08,539 --> 00:00:10,179 [Speaker 2]
Un peu.

00:00:10,179 --> 00:00:12,199 [Speaker 1]
Est-ce que vous êtes américain?

00:00:12,199 --> 00:00:15,859 [Speaker 2]
Oui. Est-ce que vous comprenez l'anglais, Mademoiselle?

00:00:15,859 --> 00:00:18,899 [Speaker 1]
Non, Monsieur, je ne comprends pas l'anglais.

00:00:18,899 --> 00:00:21,579 [Speaker 0]
Listen again.

00:00:21,579 --> 00:00:24,600 [Speaker 1]
Pardon, Monsieur. Est-ce que vous comprenez le français?

00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,079 [Speaker 2]
Un peu.

00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:27,680 [Speaker 1]
Est-ce que vous êtes Américain?

00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,199 [Speaker 2]
Oui. Est-ce que vous comprenez l'anglais, Mademoiselle?

00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,180 [Speaker 1]
Non, Monsieur, je ne comprends pas l'anglais.

00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:38,399 [Speaker 0]
Say the word « English » in French.

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,239 [Speaker 1]
L'anglais.

00:00:41,239 --> 00:00:46,399 [Speaker 0]
Say « French », meaning the French language.

00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:49,840 [Speaker 1]
Le français.

00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,199 [Speaker 1]
Le français.

00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:58,020 [Speaker 0]
Say « I understand. »

00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:01,859 [Speaker 1]
Je comprends.

00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:05,599 [Speaker 1]
Je comprends.

00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:11,819 [Speaker 0]
And now say « I understand French. »

00:01:11,819 --> 00:01:16,739 [Speaker 1]
Je comprends le français.

00:01:16,739 --> 00:01:18,619 [Speaker 0]
Notice that although you're saying-

00:01:18,619 --> 00:01:19,619 [Speaker 1]
Le français

00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:26,159 [Speaker 0]
The word « le » is very lightly pronounced. Listen again.

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,339 [Speaker 1]
Je comprends le français.

00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:31,599 [Speaker 1]
Je comprends le français.

00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:32,079 [Speaker 0]
The-

00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:32,719 [Speaker 1]
Le.

00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:39,259 [Speaker 0]
Is just sort of tacked on to the previous word. Now practice pronouncing it after the French speaker.

00:01:39,259 --> 00:01:44,119 [Speaker 1]
Je comprends le français.

00:01:44,119 --> 00:01:47,099 [Speaker 1]
Prends le.

00:01:47,099 --> 00:01:50,119 [Speaker 1]
Prends le.

00:01:50,119 --> 00:01:55,059 [Speaker 1]
Je comprends le français.

00:01:55,059 --> 00:01:59,919 [Speaker 1]
Je comprends le français.

00:01:59,919 --> 00:02:05,039 [Speaker 0]
Tell me that you understand French.

00:02:05,039 --> 00:02:09,539 [Speaker 1]
Je comprends le français.

00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:12,579 [Speaker 0]
A little.

00:02:12,579 --> 00:02:15,659 [Speaker 1]
Un peu.

00:02:15,659 --> 00:02:22,199 [Speaker 0]
Now tell me that you understand French a little.

00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:28,279 [Speaker 1]
Je comprends un peu le français.

00:02:28,279 --> 00:02:34,259 [Speaker 1]

00:02:34,259 --> 00:02:39,059 [Speaker 0]
Ask me if I understand.

00:02:39,059 --> 00:02:43,679 [Speaker 1]
Est-ce que vous comprenez?

00:02:43,679 --> 00:02:48,479 [Speaker 1]
Est-ce que vous comprenez?

00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:54,839 [Speaker 0]
Ask me if I understand French.

00:02:54,839 --> 00:03:01,079 [Speaker 1]
Est-ce que vous comprenez le français?

00:03:01,079 --> 00:03:08,099 [Speaker 0]
Once again, notice how slight the L sound is, but it is there. Listen and repeat.

00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:14,359 [Speaker 1]
Est-ce que vous comprenez le français?

00:03:14,359 --> 00:03:20,639 [Speaker 1]
Est-ce que vous comprenez le français?

00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:26,659 [Speaker 0]
Ask, « Do you understand English? »

00:03:26,659 --> 00:03:32,119 [Speaker 1]
Est-ce que vous comprenez l'anglais?

00:03:32,119 --> 00:03:36,139 [Speaker 0]
Say, « No, sir. »

00:03:36,139 --> 00:03:39,779 [Speaker 2]
Non, Monsieur.

00:03:39,779 --> 00:03:44,919 [Speaker 0]
Say, « I don't understand. »

00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:49,079 [Speaker 1]
Je ne comprends pas.

00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:51,819 [Speaker 0]
Here, notice how the N sound on-

00:03:51,819 --> 00:03:52,219 [Speaker 1]
Je ne-

00:03:52,219 --> 00:03:56,439 [Speaker 0]
... is also very slight. Listen and repeat.

00:03:56,439 --> 00:04:01,319 [Speaker 1]
Je ne comprends pas.

00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:06,099 [Speaker 1]
Je ne comprends pas.

00:04:06,099 --> 00:04:12,459 [Speaker 0]
Say, "I don't understand English."

00:04:12,459 --> 00:04:17,899 [Speaker 1]
Je ne comprends pas l'anglais.

00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:23,259 [Speaker 1]
Je ne comprends pas l'anglais.

00:04:23,259 --> 00:04:29,839 [Speaker 0]
And now say, "I don't understand French."

00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:35,199 [Speaker 1]
Je ne comprends pas le français.

00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,599 [Speaker 0]
Did you observe the N sound in-

00:04:37,599 --> 00:04:38,339 [Speaker 1]
Je ne.

00:04:38,339 --> 00:04:40,579 [Speaker 0]
And also the L sound in-

00:04:40,579 --> 00:04:42,019 [Speaker 1]
pas le français?

00:04:42,019 --> 00:04:44,679 [Speaker 0]
Repeat again after the speaker.

00:04:44,679 --> 00:04:50,559 [Speaker 1]
Je ne comprends pas le français.

00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:56,459 [Speaker 1]
Je ne comprends pas le français.

00:04:56,459 --> 00:05:02,339 [Speaker 0]
And how would you say, "I understand a little."

00:05:02,339 --> 00:05:07,019 [Speaker 1]
Je comprends un peu.

00:05:07,019 --> 00:05:13,659 [Speaker 0]
Say again, "I don't understand French."

00:05:13,659 --> 00:05:19,339 [Speaker 1]
Je ne comprends pas le français.

00:05:19,339 --> 00:05:24,239 [Speaker 0]
I understand English.

00:05:24,239 --> 00:05:29,039 [Speaker 1]
Je comprends l'anglais.

00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:34,599 [Speaker 0]
I understand English a little.

00:05:34,599 --> 00:05:40,079 [Speaker 1]
Je comprends un peu l'anglais.

00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:44,059 [Speaker 1]
Peu l'anglais.

00:05:44,059 --> 00:05:48,019 [Speaker 1]
Peu l'anglais.

00:05:48,019 --> 00:05:53,579 [Speaker 1]
Je comprends un peu l'anglais.

00:05:53,579 --> 00:05:57,319 [Speaker 0]
Say, "You are."

00:05:57,319 --> 00:06:00,639 [Speaker 1]
Vous êtes.

00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:05,873 [Speaker 0]
Say, "You are American."

00:06:05,873 --> 00:06:10,074 [Speaker 1]
Vous êtes américain.

00:06:10,074 --> 00:06:14,333 [Speaker 1]
Vous êtes américain.

00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:19,753 [Speaker 0]
Ask, "Are you American?"

00:06:19,753 --> 00:06:24,953 [Speaker 1]
Est-ce que vous êtes américain?

00:06:24,953 --> 00:06:30,213 [Speaker 1]
Est-ce que vous êtes américain?

00:06:30,213 --> 00:06:34,413 [Speaker 0]
Say, "Yes, Miss."

00:06:34,413 --> 00:06:38,073 [Speaker 1]
Oui, Mademoiselle.

00:06:38,073 --> 00:06:42,653 [Speaker 0]
How do you say, "Sir," or "Mr."?

00:06:42,653 --> 00:06:45,714 [Speaker 1]
Monsieur.

00:06:45,714 --> 00:06:49,493 [Speaker 0]
Say, "No, sir."

00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:52,874 [Speaker 2]
Non, Monsieur.

00:06:52,874 --> 00:06:56,813 [Speaker 0]
Say, "Miss."

00:06:56,813 --> 00:07:00,433 [Speaker 1]
Mademoiselle.

00:07:00,433 --> 00:07:02,133 [Speaker 0]
Does your pronunciation of-

00:07:02,133 --> 00:07:02,813 [Speaker 1]
Mademoiselle

00:07:02,813 --> 00:07:08,313 [Speaker 0]
... sound like the speaker's? Repeat after him, part by part.

00:07:08,313 --> 00:07:11,113 [Speaker 1]
Selle.

00:07:11,113 --> 00:07:13,894 [Speaker 1]
Selle.

00:07:13,894 --> 00:07:16,593 [Speaker 1]
Moi.

00:07:16,593 --> 00:07:19,214 [Speaker 1]
Moi.

00:07:19,214 --> 00:07:22,894 [Speaker 1]
Moiselle.

00:07:22,894 --> 00:07:25,894 [Speaker 1]
Moiselle.

00:07:25,894 --> 00:07:28,733 [Speaker 1]
Mad.

00:07:28,733 --> 00:07:31,593 [Speaker 1]
Mad.

00:07:31,593 --> 00:07:35,513 [Speaker 1]
Mademoiselle.

00:07:35,513 --> 00:07:39,293 [Speaker 1]
Mademoiselle.

00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:44,153 [Speaker 0]
Say, "Excuse me, miss."

00:07:44,153 --> 00:07:48,633 [Speaker 1]
Pardon, Mademoiselle.

00:07:48,633 --> 00:07:54,313 [Speaker 0]
Say, "I understand French."

00:07:54,313 --> 00:07:59,013 [Speaker 1]
Je comprends le français.

00:07:59,013 --> 00:08:02,753 [Speaker 0]
Say, "A little."

00:08:02,753 --> 00:08:05,973 [Speaker 1]
Un peu.

00:08:05,973 --> 00:08:12,993 [Speaker 0]
Say, "I understand French a little."

00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:19,394 [Speaker 1]
Je comprends un peu le français.

00:08:19,394 --> 00:08:25,553 [Speaker 1]
Je comprends un peu le français.

00:08:25,553 --> 00:08:31,773 [Speaker 0]
Do you remember how to ask, "Are you American?"

00:08:31,773 --> 00:08:36,853 [Speaker 1]
Est-ce que vous êtes américain?

00:08:36,853 --> 00:08:41,974 [Speaker 1]
Est-ce que vous êtes américain?

00:08:41,974 --> 00:08:48,873 [Speaker 0]
How would she say to him, "Yes, you're American"?

00:08:48,873 --> 00:08:54,834 [Speaker 2]
Oui, vous êtes américain.

00:08:54,834 --> 00:09:00,754 [Speaker 2]
Oui, vous êtes américain.

00:09:00,754 --> 00:09:04,993 [Speaker 0]
You understand English.

00:09:04,993 --> 00:09:09,193 [Speaker 1]
Vous comprenez l'anglais.

00:09:09,193 --> 00:09:14,153 [Speaker 0]
Say, "You understand."

00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:18,174 [Speaker 1]
Vous comprenez.

00:09:18,174 --> 00:09:23,773 [Speaker 0]
Ask, "Do you understand?"

00:09:23,773 --> 00:09:28,813 [Speaker 1]
Est-ce que vous comprenez?

00:09:28,813 --> 00:09:36,653 [Speaker 0]
Ask the woman, "Do you understand English?"

00:09:36,653 --> 00:09:43,873 [Speaker 1]
Est-ce que vous comprenez l'anglais?

00:09:43,873 --> 00:09:51,013 [Speaker 1]
Est-ce que vous comprenez l'anglais?

00:09:51,013 --> 00:09:55,013 [Speaker 0]
Say, "No, Sir."

00:09:55,013 --> 00:09:58,653 [Speaker 2]
Non, Monsieur.

00:09:58,653 --> 00:10:03,754 [Speaker 0]
Say, "I don't understand."

00:10:03,754 --> 00:10:07,953 [Speaker 2]
Je ne comprends pas.

00:10:07,953 --> 00:10:12,273 [Speaker 0]
Here's how the French say, "Hello, good morning," or, "Hi."

00:10:12,273 --> 00:10:13,693 [Speaker 1]
Bonjour.

00:10:13,693 --> 00:10:19,373 [Speaker 0]
This literally means good day. First, the word, good. Listen and repeat.

00:10:19,373 --> 00:10:21,953 [Speaker 1]
Bon.

00:10:21,953 --> 00:10:24,513 [Speaker 1]
Bon.

00:10:24,513 --> 00:10:27,093 [Speaker 1]
Bon.

00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:29,873 [Speaker 0]
Now, the word day.

00:10:29,873 --> 00:10:33,233 [Speaker 1]
Jour.

00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:36,513 [Speaker 1]
Jour.

00:10:36,513 --> 00:10:39,894 [Speaker 1]
Jour.

00:10:39,894 --> 00:10:43,274 [Speaker 1]
Bonjour.

00:10:43,274 --> 00:10:46,733 [Speaker 1]
Bonjour.

00:10:46,733 --> 00:10:51,453 [Speaker 0]
Say, "Hello, Miss."

00:10:51,453 --> 00:10:56,013 [Speaker 1]
Bonjour, Mademoiselle.

00:10:56,013 --> 00:11:00,554 [Speaker 1]
Bonjour, Mademoiselle.

00:11:00,554 --> 00:11:05,533 [Speaker 0]
If the woman were married, here's how you would address her. Listen and repeat.

00:11:05,533 --> 00:11:08,753 [Speaker 1]
Madame.

00:11:08,753 --> 00:11:11,753 [Speaker 1]
Madame.

00:11:11,753 --> 00:11:14,713 [Speaker 1]
Madame.

00:11:14,713 --> 00:11:19,174 [Speaker 0]
Say, "Good morning, ma'am."

00:11:19,174 --> 00:11:23,093 [Speaker 1]
Bonjour, Madame.

00:11:23,093 --> 00:11:27,133 [Speaker 1]
Bonjour, Madame.

00:11:27,133 --> 00:11:31,193 [Speaker 0]
Say, "Good morning, sir."

00:11:31,193 --> 00:11:34,653 [Speaker 1]
Bonjour, Monsieur.

00:11:34,653 --> 00:11:40,693 [Speaker 0]
Now you want to ask, "How are you?" First, let's practice the word, how.

00:11:40,693 --> 00:11:43,373 [Speaker 1]
Comment.

00:11:43,373 --> 00:11:45,894 [Speaker 1]
Comment.

00:11:45,894 --> 00:11:48,554 [Speaker 1]
Comment.

00:11:48,554 --> 00:11:51,733 [Speaker 0]
Say, "How."

00:11:51,733 --> 00:11:54,313 [Speaker 1]
Comment.

00:11:54,313 --> 00:12:02,834 [Speaker 0]
For, "How are you?" The French say, "How do you go?" So here is how to say, "You go." Listen and repeat.

00:12:02,834 --> 00:12:06,233 [Speaker 1]
Vous allez.

00:12:06,233 --> 00:12:09,933 [Speaker 1]
Vous allez.

00:12:09,933 --> 00:12:13,312 [Speaker 1]
Vous allez.

00:12:13,312 --> 00:12:17,291 [Speaker 0]
Say, you go.

00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:20,531 [Speaker 1]
Vous allez.

00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:35,731 [Speaker 0]
In order to make this into a question, we could use the est-ce que form. But in this case, another way is more common. Instead of saying vous allez, just turn it around and say allez-vous? This makes it a question.

00:12:35,731 --> 00:12:40,751 [Speaker 0]
Now listen and repeat as the speaker asks, how are you?

00:12:40,751 --> 00:12:43,751 [Speaker 1]
Comment allez-vous?

00:12:43,751 --> 00:12:47,731 [Speaker 1]
Comment allez-vous?

00:12:47,731 --> 00:12:51,631 [Speaker 0]
Did you notice the T sound at the end of comment? Listen again.

00:12:51,631 --> 00:12:54,631 [Speaker 1]
Comment allez-vous?

00:12:54,631 --> 00:13:06,051 [Speaker 0]
This shows that the word comment is spelled with a T at the end. But this is a disappearing sound. It is pronounced only when the next word begins with a vowel, as allez does here.

00:13:06,051 --> 00:13:11,051 [Speaker 0]
Say the word how alone.
