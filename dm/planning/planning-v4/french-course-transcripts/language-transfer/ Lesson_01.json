I wanted to begin by speaking about how, in English, we already use a lot of French in English. English is a language, it's kind of half Germanic and half Latin. Somewhere there in the middle. You know, a lot of the time we have two words to say the same thing, and one sounds formal and the other one sounds informal. And you know, one is... The formal one is Latin and the informal one is Germanic. You know, you could have, for example, \"to ask,\" which is very Germanic, and then \"to inquire,\" you know, which is very Latin. That Latin word is often going to sound like a French word. So we already speak or use a lot of French in our English, even though we may not realize it. For example, the word for \"cake\" in French is \"gâteau.\""

We can also learn some tricks to convert huge groups of words into French from our Latin English or our French English. Now, whenever we have an I-O-N word in English like \"invitation,\" \"opinion,\" \"participation,\" we can identify this word as coming from Latin by its I-O-N ending, which means it is probably the same in French as most of Latin English came to English through French.
