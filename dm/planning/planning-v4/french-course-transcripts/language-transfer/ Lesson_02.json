Yes. \"Invitation\"? Yes. And if so, then you can probably find the verb in French. So, how would you say \"participation\"?"

And not realize that you can say that in French because you don't think of \"to participate\" for \"to get involved\". Now, often the French way of saying things will sound much more formal in English. \"I want to participate\" sounds more formal than \"I want to get involved\". Now, but \"je veux participer\" just sounds like \"I want to get involved\" in French. It sounds very everyday. So sometimes you'll have to make that jump yourself to find the word you're looking for. \"To get involved\", oh, is there an \"ation\" way of saying that? \"Participation\", ah, okay. \"Participer\". How would you say \"I want to get involved a little?\" \"I want to get involved a little?\""
