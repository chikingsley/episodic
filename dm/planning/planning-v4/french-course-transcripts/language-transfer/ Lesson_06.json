That's really important for us to take French away from this experience. The pauses are always around a second and a half, that's because the track's been edited. Maybe the student here answers after one second, maybe after a minute, but that's always going to be edited so feel free to pause and take whatever time you need to have the thoughts that you need to have to confidently and correctly build the sentence. This course has been very carefully thought out to guide certain thoughts, and these thoughts are the most important thing about what we're doing. So you shouldn't be worrying about memorizing or how much of this will I remember, or writing things down. You should only care about following the explanations, having the thoughts that you have when you follow those explanations, and then building the sentence in your own time. What was \"I want\" in French?"

We pronounce that \"N\" on the end because it's \"N-E.\" The \"N\" isn't actually on the end. \"Machine.\" And like in \"chose,\" \"the word for thing,\" we have \"C-H\" giving us \"sh.\" And it's a feminine word, so how would you say \"the machine\"?"
