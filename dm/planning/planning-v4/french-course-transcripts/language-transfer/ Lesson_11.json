        "text": "Now, because French has so many different vowel sounds, we want to pay special attention to how the vowel might change because of a written accent, as we've seen with the E, for example, no? We have, \"le,\" [schwa sound] \"je,\" [schwa sound] \"recommander,\" [schwa R sound with nasal 'a' sound] no? Where the E has no accent. And then we have like, \"è,\" [French 'eh' sound] like in \"réserver.\" [French 'eh' sound] We also saw the E with the little hat on the top, like in \"fête,\" [French 'eh' sound] \"party,\" like school fete in English. And we also want to notice how a vowel might change forming part of a combination of letters, no? We've seen, for example, \"EU,\" no? As in, \"peu,\" \"un peu,\" [nasal 'un' sound] \"je peux,\" as in, \"veux.\" And we've seen \"OI,\" like in \"je dois,\" [French 'wa' sound] giving us a \"wa\" [French 'wa' sound] sound. But it's not just combinations of vowels. For example, we've also seen how N's and M's on the end of syllables combine with the previous vowels to change their sound, like in \"confirmer.\" [nasal 'a' sound] We can revise this actually counting to three in French. So, the number \"one\" is the same as \"A.\" So what is \"A\" for masculine like in \"a little\"?"

        "text": "Un, [nasal 'un' sound] now so for \"one\" we have \"un,\" [nasal 'un' sound] like in \"un peu,\" [nasal 'un' sound] no? That reminds us of how the N gets swallowed into that U and how it changes the pronunciation. And then \"une\" [pronounced N] for the feminine, with the E on the end, giving us two syllables really, 'cause it should be \"u-ne,\" although that E generally isn't pronounced in most dialects of French, so we get \"une.\" [pronounced N] So this reminds us of how the N combines with the U, or talking more generally, how the N or the M on the end of a syllable can combine with the previous vowel and change its sound. The word for \"two\" in French is spelled \"D-E-U-X.\" \"D-E-U-X.\" So how do you say \"two,\" like the number \"two\" in French?"

We have the silent X on the end again. And \"EU\" like in \"je veux,\" [French 'eu' sound] \"de.\" [French 'eu' sound] And \"de\" actually is related to like \"duo.\" The word for \"three\" in French is \"trois.\" [French 'wa' sound] Spelled \"T-R-O-I-S.\" So again, we have the \"O-I\" there giving us \"wa,\" [French 'wa' sound] just like in \"je dois,\" [French 'wa' sound] \"I must.\" \"Un,\" [nasal 'un' sound] \"deux,\" [French 'eu' sound] \"trois.\" [French 'wa' sound] So if we put our energy into trying to inspire ourselves to analyze the French we expose ourselves to, look what we got out of just \"one,\" \"two,\" \"three,\" when we look at it through that analytical eye. Just trying to think and find examples of what we know through the French that we expose ourselves to, things that we recognize that make us think. And in this way, we don't have to worry about forgetting anything. Everything is always just out there in the French that you expose yourself to, waiting for you to clarify your doubts looking at it.

Now, the first E of \"elle\" sounds like 'eh' [open 'e' sound] rather than the E, how the E usually sounds without an accent like in \"je,\" [schwa sound] \"de.\" [schwa sound] And that's because what we read is the combination of \"E-L\" rather than just the E. We read the syllable, \"E-L,\" giving us \"elle.\" [open 'e' sound] So we have \"elle doit\" [open 'e' sound] for \"she must.\" How would you say \"she must visit,\" \"she has to visit\"?"

        "speaker": "Teacher",
        "text": "Elle doit visiter.\" [open 'e' sound] So we saw how with \"elle\" [open 'e' sound] we have this E without an accent which we're used to sounding like \"eu,\" as in \"je,\" [schwa sound] \"de,\" [schwa sound] but taking on a different sound when it combines as a syllable with the letter L and we get \"elle,\" [open 'e' sound] spelled \"E-L-L-E.\" So be them combinations of vowels or vowels with consonants, we want to get in the habit of noticing syllables and the sounds that they give us. Actually, phonetic writing, like writing one sound per letter, as far as we know, was invented just once in all of history. All phonetic alphabets, like the English or Latin alphabet, no? Like Greek, like Arabic, all share the same roots. They all sprung from the same crazy thought of dividing up language into unique sounds rather than into syllables. This is because it's so much more intuitive and sensible actually to think about syllables in language rather than individual sounds. So that means to think about \"po,\" \"pa,\" \"pi,\" rather than thinking of P and \"ah\" separately, which is what most writing systems did. Most writing systems developed syllabaries. So in French, although we use the Latin alphabet, which is phonetic, we might want to get in the habit of thinking in syllables, which is much more intuitive, recognizing combinations of letters and thinking in those combinations of letters. So give me again \"she must.\""

We've seen how an O gives us oh, but how an \"O-N\" gives us a nasal 'oh' sound, and how an I gives us 'ih', as in \"bicyclette,\" but how an \"I-N\" gives us a nasal 'in' sound, like in \"invite.\" So, we will continue ordering all of this information. Now, the most important thing is to get in the habit of analyzing and also trying to find examples of what we know and what we think we know in the French that we come across. And then, this way not panicking, not trying to memorize because memorizing as well, and the habit of memorizing, lets a lot of information get crossed over and confused. And what we're doing is something else. We're learning to constantly analyze with our curiosity and to use the French that we come across and that we expose ourselves to, to remind ourselves of what we know. And to clarify what we're not so sure of."
