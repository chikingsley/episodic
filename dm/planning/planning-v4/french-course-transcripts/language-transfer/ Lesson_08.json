They get kind of swallowed into the nose and affect the vowel before them. This means a word can often sound quite different to how it's written, like the word for now in French, which is spelled as if it were \"maintenant\" but sounds like..."

Not the word \"now\", but the meaning of \"now\", \"maintenant\", like maintain, no? Maintain has a connection to now. Maintaining is all about bringing into the now, no? So this also means that if we hear a T, for example, on the end of a word which is a consonant, no, a T, so the vowel, like in \"la porte,\" \"la visite,\" \"trente,\" [nasal 'a' sound] \"thirty,\" that the word probably doesn't end in a consonant. Otherwise, we wouldn't hear it. \"La porte,\" \"la visite,\" \"trente\" [nasal 'a' sound] are all, of course, spelled with a final E. In the same way, we have, for example, \"la baguette.\" \"La baguette,\" spelled \"B-A-G-U-E-T-T-E,\" just like in English. The E on the end lets us know to sound the consonant before it. \"Baguette.\""

So if we mean \"la baguette,\" we use \"la\" for it. \"Je la veux.\" So we noticed that \"baguette\" is feminine, no? \"La baguette.\" And as I mentioned with the \"I-O-N\" words, like \"tradition,\" \"collection,\" \"célébration,\" which are also feminine. We have \"la tradition,\" \"la collection,\" no? Then we can look to the end of words to see if we found a pattern for gender, like in how we identified that the \"I-O-N\" words were feminine. So we have \"la baguette.\" We also have \"la cigarette,\" spelled like in English. \"La cigarette.\""

You know, \"do you want it\"? \"Do you want it to happen,\" for example. Or, you know, something general, we can also use this \"le.\" So we have learnt how the word for it goes before the verb, no, before the words like want, which comes from \"to want\". To words are verbs, no? \"To want,\" \"to be able,\" \"to owe,\" or \"to prepare.\" So we've seen how it comes before our verb, \"tu le veux.\" If we want to say something like, \"I want to repair it. Can you repair it?\" then the it goes before the verb that's talking about it. So just as we say, \"Tu le veux,\" when we mean \"You want it,\" we put it before the verb that refers to it. If we say, for example, \"I want to repair it,\" we'll say, \"I want it repair,\" because repair refers to it, no? \"I want to repair it.\" And we keep that it just before the verb that's talking about it. So we say, \"I want it repair.\" \"I want it to repair.\" So how would you say that? \"I want to repair it.\""
