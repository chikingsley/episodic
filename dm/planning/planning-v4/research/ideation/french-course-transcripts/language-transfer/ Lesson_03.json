Then we'll notice all of the words that we can convert over. Mostly, we'll just have to change a little the way we pronounce those words, but we can have a go and see the feedback and see how quickly we're understood and ask natives for the pronunciation, but we can always, you know, make that attempt and try to pull words out of our Latin English or our French English. And we also want to be constantly listening out for words we might recognize too, just that they will sound a little different in French. The more we do that, the more we'll train our ear and begin to notice many, many words in French that we recognize through English. \"Thing\" was \"chose.\" And \"something\"?"
