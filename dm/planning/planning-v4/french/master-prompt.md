# MASTER PROMPT FOR AUDIO LANGUAGE COURSE DISSECTION

Objective: Conduct an in-depth pedagogical, structural, and content analysis of the provided audio language lesson transcripts. The goal is to reverse-engineer the teaching methodology to inform the design of a narrative-driven, speaking-focused language learning application.
Input: A series of transcribed audio lessons ([Specify Method, e.g., "Pimsleur French I, Lessons X-Y," "Michel Thomas Foundation CD Z, Tracks A-B," "Paul Noble French CD Q, Lessons R-S"]). Prioritize transcripts with speaker diarization and detailed timestamps if available.
Analysis Dimensions (Go as deep as possible on each):
Core Pedagogical Philosophy & Assumptions:
What are the stated or implied learning theories behind this method? (e.g., behaviorism, cognitivism, constructivism, comprehensible input, explicit instruction, spaced repetition).
What does this method assume about the learner (e.g., motivation, prior knowledge, learning style, time commitment)?
What are its primary strengths and weaknesses from a pedagogical standpoint for adult L2 acquisition, particularly for spoken fluency?
Structural Analysis & Pacing:
Lesson/Track Structure: How are individual lessons/tracks structured? (e.g., intro dialogue, breakdown, drill, recombination, summary).
Pacing: How much new material is introduced per unit of time (e.g., per lesson, per 5 minutes)?
English vs. Target Language Ratio: Quantify the proportion of instruction/explanation in English versus active practice/exposure in the target language. How does this ratio evolve over the lessons provided?
Silence/Pauses: What is the role and frequency of silence or pauses for student thought/production?
Vocabulary Acquisition Strategy:
Introduction Rate: How many new unique words/phrases are introduced per lesson/track?
Selection Criteria: What seems to govern the choice of initial vocabulary? (e.g., high frequency, situational utility, cognates, thematic grouping).
Cognate Strategy: Is there an explicit or implicit strategy for leveraging English-target language cognates? If so, what are the rules/patterns taught?
Presentation: Are words introduced in isolation, within phrases, or through rules?
Grammar Introduction Strategy:
Implicit vs. Explicit: Is grammar taught implicitly through pattern exposure and repetition, or explicitly through rules and explanations? Provide specific examples.
Sequencing: What grammatical concepts are introduced, and in what order? (e.g., verb conjugations for specific persons, tenses, negation, question formation, pronouns, prepositions).
Simplification/Heuristics: Does the method use any simplifications, "rules of thumb," or memorable heuristics for complex grammar points?
"Handle" Verbs/Structures: Are there core grammatical structures (like auxiliary verbs + infinitive) that are taught early to enable quick sentence construction?
Repetition & Reinforcement Mechanics:
Spaced Repetition: Is there evidence of a systematic spaced repetition algorithm (like Pimsleur's)? If so, can you identify the recall intervals for specific lexical items or structures within the provided data?
Clustered Repetition/Drilling: How are new items drilled immediately after introduction?
Recycling: How is previously learned material re-integrated and reviewed in later lessons? What's the pattern?
Error Correction: (If student interactions are present/diarized) How are student errors typically handled? (e.g., direct correction, re-prompting, re-explanation).
Pronunciation & Speaking Focus:
Phonetic Focus: Are specific sounds, intonation patterns, or liaisons explicitly taught or drilled? How?
Production Pressure: How much time is the learner expected to be actively speaking/producing the language?
Authenticity: How authentic or natural-sounding is the target language presented (e.g., formal vs. informal, speed, native speaker models)?
Learner Experience & Engagement:
Cognitive Load: How demanding does the method appear to be per lesson?
Confidence Building: What elements contribute to (or detract from) learner confidence?
"Fun Factor"/Engagement: Does the method incorporate any elements of story, humor, or intrinsic motivation beyond pure language acquisition? (Often absent, but note if present).
Comparative Analysis (If other methods have been previously analyzed):
How does this method's approach to [vocabulary, grammar, repetition, etc.] compare to [Pimsleur/Michel Thomas/Paul Noble]? What are the key similarities and crucial differences?
Which specific techniques from this method could be valuably adapted or blended into a new, hybrid learning application?
Progression Towards Proficiency:
Based on the content covered, what approximate CEFR level (or equivalent) does this set of lessons appear to aim for or achieve in terms of spoken production and comprehension?
What are the explicit or implicit "learning targets" for this block of lessons?
Output Format: Please provide a structured breakdown, using headings for each analysis dimension. Use bullet points and concrete examples from the transcripts to support your findings. Conclude with a summary of the method's core "blueprint" and its potential contributions to an innovative language app.
