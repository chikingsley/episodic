00:00-00:04
How would you say, at what time do you arrive?

00:04-00:08
Now, you may say, well, what is to arrive?

00:08-00:21
At this point, I would like to encourage you, to encourage you, to guess as far as vocabulary is concerned.

00:21-00:24
Not structure, no guessing.

00:24-00:28
But vocabulary, you can guess.

00:29-00:46
But because more and more you will développer, develop a sense, a sentiment, a sentiment, a feeling, pour la langue, to know which words are d'origine française or French origin.

00:46-00:49
So in vocabulary, you can guess.

00:49-00:54
So how would you say, at what time do you arrive tomorrow?

00:57-00:57
Right.

00:57-00:57
Right.

00:57-00:57
Right.

00:57-01:02
So arrive is to arrive.

01:02-01:04
Arrivez-vous?

01:04-01:05
Do you arrive?

01:05-01:07
At what time are you arriving?

01:09-01:23
At what time do we arrive in Paris tomorrow morning?

01:23-01:25
Tomorrow is demain.

01:25-01:26
Demain.

01:26-01:26
Demain.

01:26-01:28
And tomorrow morning, demain matin.

01:28-01:30
Matin means morning.

01:32-01:33
We have matinee.

01:33-01:34
Matinee.

01:34-01:35
Matinee.

01:35-01:35
Matinee.

01:35-01:35
Matinee.

01:35-01:35
Matinee.

01:35-01:35
Matinee.

01:35-01:35
Matinee.

01:35-01:35
Matinee.

01:35-01:39
You may wonder, what does matinee have to do with morning? Yes.

01:39-01:40
Matinee.

01:40-01:41
Matinee.

01:41-01:52
Matinee actually means the whole morning. And originally, it was a morning performance that got later and later.

01:52-01:53
Matinee.

01:53-01:53
Right.

01:53-02:02
Like, passer la matinée is to spend the whole morning. But matin is just morning.

02:02-02:02
Right.

02:02-02:02
Yes.

02:02-02:11
like ce soir is this evening, but to spend the whole evening would be passer la soirée.

02:11-02:17
Good day is bonjour.

02:17-02:23
Jour is day, spelled J-O-U-R.

02:23-02:25
Right, bonjour is good day.

02:25-02:28
Bonjour madame, bonjour monsieur, bonjour.

02:30-02:37
But to spend the whole day would be passer la journée.

02:37-02:46
And in English we have journey that comes from it because it was a whole day trip,

02:46-02:49
usually by stagecoach.

02:49-02:56
So le jour is the day, bonjour, but passer la journée would be to spend the whole day.

02:57-03:00
Passer la soirée to spend the whole evening.

03:00-03:03
Passer la matinée to spend the whole morning.

03:03-03:10
But tomorrow morning would be demain matin.

03:10-03:10
Matin.

03:10-03:11
Matin, right.

03:11-03:13
Demain matin.

03:13-03:19
So at what time do we arrive in Paris tomorrow morning?

03:19-03:23
In or to for cities is à.

03:23-03:28
À Paris would be in Paris or to Paris.

03:28-03:32
For countries, we had en France.

03:33-03:40
In England or to England.

03:40-03:43
À Londres.

03:43-03:47
In London or to London.

03:47-03:52
So at what time do we arrive in Paris tomorrow morning?

03:54-04:01
À quelle heure arrivons-nous à Paris demain matin?

04:01-04:01
Right.

04:01-04:06
À quelle heure arrivons-nous à Paris demain matin?

04:06-04:08
Because I am.

04:10-04:11

04:23-04:28
But there is no am with ing, no is with ing, no are with ing.

04:28-04:31
No am-ing, no is-ing, no are-ing.

04:33-04:38
If there's no ing, then you have the green light.

04:38-04:39
Then you follow the English literally.

04:39-04:39
Yes.

04:39-04:40
