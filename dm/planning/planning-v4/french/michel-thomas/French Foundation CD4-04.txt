00:00-00:15
Yes, it is curious because it's only with to go that you have that separation between aller, vous allez, nous allons, and je vais for I am going and va for is going.

00:15-00:25
What happened here is that the French took two different Latin verbs for to go and combined them into one.

00:27-00:39
It comes from the Latin originally ambulare, where we have preamble, ambulatory, ambulance, and so on.

00:39-00:47
Yes, ambulare that became later ambulare and allare, and from allare, aller, to go.

00:47-00:50
For vous allez, nous allons.

00:50-00:51
Yes.

00:53-01:00
I am going and va for is going comes from the Latin vadere for to go.

01:00-01:06
You may have heard the expression quo vadis, which in Latin means where goest thou.

01:06-01:12
But in English we have to invade, comes from it, to go in.

01:12-01:13
Right.

01:13-01:14
Evade, evasive.

01:14-01:18
There you have the ve and va.

01:18-01:34
I did tell you at one point that for he, she, it, that with all verbs you follow the same sound as I.

01:36-01:44
For instance, if you want to say he can, think of I can, which is he'll...

01:44-01:46
Peu.

01:46-01:47
Il peut.

01:47-01:48
She can.

01:48-01:49
Elle peut.

01:49-01:50
Right.

01:50-01:50
Who can.

01:50-01:51
Qui peut.

01:51-01:52
It can.

01:52-01:54
Ça peut.

01:54-01:55
Ça peut.

01:55-01:56
Yes.

01:57-02:01
If you want to say, I would like...

02:01-02:04
Je voudrais.

02:04-02:04
Right.

02:04-02:09
Everybody would like to be here.

02:09-02:12
Tout le monde voudrait...

02:12-02:14
Voudrait?

02:14-02:15
Of course.

02:15-02:17
Tout le monde voudrait...

02:17-02:19
Sorry, what was the rest of it?

02:19-02:19
To be here.

02:19-02:21
Etre ici.

02:21-02:22
Right.

02:22-02:24
Tout le monde voudrait être ici.

02:24-02:27
Everybody must leave soon.

02:27-02:35
Tout le monde doit partir bientôt.

02:35-02:35
Right.

02:35-02:38
Tout le monde doit partir bientôt.

02:38-02:41
So you follow the sound of I, yes?

02:41-02:41
Right.

02:41-02:44
Who speaks English here?

02:44-02:47
Qui parle...

02:47-02:48
Qui, pense-moi?

02:48-02:50
Qui parle...

02:50-02:50
Qui...

02:50-02:51
Qui...

02:51-02:53
Oh, no.

02:53-02:54
Qui parle...

02:54-02:56
No, that's to speak.

02:56-02:58
Okay.

02:58-03:01
For I, he, she, it, and so on...

03:01-03:04
You cut off the R of the verb.

03:04-03:05
Yes.

03:05-03:06
So to speak is...

03:06-03:09
To speak is parler.

03:09-03:11
Not parler, but parler.

03:11-03:12
Parler, sorry.

03:12-03:12
Yes.

03:12-03:13
Parler.

03:13-03:13
Yes.

03:13-03:15
So I speak would be...

03:15-03:17
Je parle.

03:17-03:18
Je parle.

03:18-03:18
Yes.

03:18-03:19
Je parle.

03:19-03:23
So if you drop the R, you have an E, you sound the consonant.

03:23-03:24
Yes.

03:24-03:24
Right.

03:24-03:31
With all ER verbs, and those are more than 90% of all verbs that end in ER, you cut off the

03:31-03:32
R and you sound the consonant.

03:32-03:43
But with verbs that are not ER verbs, when you cut off the R or the IR, then you have a consonant

03:43-03:46
without an E, and you don't sound the consonant.

03:46-03:52
For instance, let's take comprendre to understand.

03:52-03:53
I understand would be...

03:53-03:55
Je comprends.

03:55-03:56
Je comprends.

03:56-03:57
Je comprends.

03:57-03:59
I don't understand.

03:59-04:03
Je ne comprends pas.

04:03-04:05
Je ne comprends pas.

04:05-04:06
He understands.

04:06-04:08
Il comprend.

04:08-04:09
Il comprend.

04:09-04:11
Nobody understands.

04:11-04:14
Personne.

04:14-04:16
Personne comprend.

04:16-04:17
Right.

04:17-04:19
You just follow the I.

04:19-04:20
Yes.

04:20-04:21
The first person.

04:21-04:22
Personne comprend.

04:22-04:25
Everybody understands very well.

04:25-04:30
Tout le monde comprend très bien.

04:30-04:31
Right.

04:31-04:33
What is...

04:33-04:36
To leave.

04:36-04:38
Partir.

04:38-04:39
Partir.

04:39-04:40
You're leaving.

04:40-04:41
Vous partez.

04:41-04:43
Vous partez.

04:43-04:44
We're leaving.

04:44-04:45
Nous partons.

04:45-04:46
Nous partons.

04:46-04:49
But I'm leaving would be...

04:49-04:50
Je part.

04:50-04:51
Je part.

04:51-04:53
Yeah, but you don't sound the...

04:53-04:53
On part.

04:53-04:54
Assez.

04:54-04:54
Yes.

04:54-04:56
You don't sound the consonant.

04:56-04:56
Je part.

04:56-04:58
It's only with this...

04:58-04:59
An ER verb.

04:59-05:02
That you will sound the consonant because you have an E.

05:02-05:03
Yes.

05:03-05:04
Not otherwise.

05:04-05:05
Right.

05:05-05:06
So je part.

05:06-05:07
Everybody is leaving.

05:07-05:10
Tout le monde part.

05:10-05:11
Tout le monde.

05:11-05:12
Monde part.

05:12-05:12
Part.

05:12-05:13
Mm-hmm.

05:13-05:14
Nobody is leaving.

05:14-05:16
Personne part.

05:16-05:16
Right.

05:16-05:19
What is to wait?

05:19-05:21
Attendez.

05:21-05:22
No.

05:22-05:23
Attend.

05:23-05:24
As attendre.

05:24-05:25
Attendre.

05:25-05:26
Attendre.

05:26-05:27
I'm waiting.

05:27-05:29
J'attends.

05:29-05:30
J'attends.

05:30-05:31
Right.

05:31-05:32
J'attends.

05:32-05:33
J'attends.

05:33-05:34
Yes.

05:34-05:35
It's not an ER verb.

05:35-05:35
Yes.

05:35-05:36
J'attends.

05:36-05:38
Everybody is waiting.

05:38-05:40
Tout le monde attend.

05:40-05:41
Tout le monde attend.

05:41-05:42
Nobody is waiting.

05:42-05:43
Personne attend.

05:43-05:44
Personne attend.

05:44-05:44
Personne attend.

05:44-05:46
So,
