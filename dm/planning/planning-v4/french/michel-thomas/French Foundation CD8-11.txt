So, I was there last night.

02:56-02:57

02:57-03:20
last night, hier soir. So I was there last night. Right, but nobody was there. Right. Personne

était là. I like or I love is j'aime. J'aime. J'aime. Yes. You may have heard je t'aime

03:36-03:43
and je vous aime and all those songs. Yes. So, but j'aime is also useful just I like. I like

03:43-03:54
to do it that way would be j'aime le faire. Right. Yes. That way. Right. Like that. Oh, comme ça.

03:54-04:01
Comme ça. J'aime le faire comme ça. J'aime le faire comme ça. So they say, oh, they don't

only say I love to do it in English, I love to do it, but how often do they say I love you?

04:09-04:23
Yes. Darling. Yes. So it's very inflationary, the word to love. Yes. No, but it is used.

04:23-04:35
Je me. But we do have, we do make a distinction in French between I love you and I like you.

04:37-04:51
That is an important distinction. J'aime is I like and I love. But if one says, je vous aime

04:51-05:02
or je t'aime, that means I love you. But I like you, they will say, je vous aime bien.

05:02-05:07
Ah. They will add bien. Bien means well. Bien.

05:07-05:15
Bien. And it means like saying, I quite love you, meaning not, not, I don't really love you.

05:15-05:21
They, she may say, je vous aime bien, mais je ne vous aime pas.

05:24-05:26
Yes. Yes. Yes. I like you, but I don't love you.

05:26-05:28
I like you, but I don't love you. Ah.

05:28-05:36
Yes. But otherwise, j'aime is used for like. J'aime le faire, yes. Je n'aime pas le faire.

05:36-05:49
J'aime pas le faire. J'aime pas le faire. J'aime pas le faire. J'aime pas le faire.

05:49-05:52
