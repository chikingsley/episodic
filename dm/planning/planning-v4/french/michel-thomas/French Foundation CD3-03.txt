00:00-00:08
So again, more than 90% of all verbs enter in -er, and -er and -ez, -ez have the same sound.

00:08-00:09
Yes.

00:09-00:18
But for vous, you have, for all verbs, -ez or -ez.

00:18-00:20
Like to leave is...

00:20-00:23
Partir.

00:23-00:24
Partir.

00:24-00:27
How would you say, you leave or you are leaving.

00:27-00:31
Vous partez.

00:31-00:33
Right.

00:33-00:34
Right.

00:34-00:36
Vous partez.

00:36-00:39
How would you spell, vous partez?

00:39-00:41
P-A-R-T-E-Z.

00:41-00:43
Right.

00:43-00:45
P-A-R-T-E-Z.

00:45-00:48
P-A-R-T-E-Z.

00:48-00:50
You are leaving.

00:50-00:54
And at what time is "à quelle heure?"

00:54-00:56
At what hour?

00:56-00:57
"à" is at.

00:57-00:59
"à quelle heure?"

00:59-01:00
At what hour?

01:00-01:02
At what time are you leaving?

01:02-01:03
Would be...

01:03-01:05
A-Q-A-L-E-Z.

01:05-01:06
"à quelle heure partez-vous?"

01:06-01:07
"à quelle heure?"

01:07-01:08
"à quelle heure partez-vous?"

01:08-01:10
At what time are you leaving?

01:10-01:12
No, "à quelle heure partez-vous?"

01:12-01:13
Right.

01:13-01:14
"à quelle heure partez-vous?"

01:14-01:16
At what time are you leaving?

01:16-01:18
At what time do you leave?

01:18-01:21
And at what time do you leave?

01:21-01:22
And at what time do you leave?

01:22-01:24
Would be...

01:24-01:28
"à quelle heure?"

01:28-01:29
Yes.

01:29-01:29
It's the same, isn't it?

01:29-01:30
Yes.

01:30-01:31
Yes.

01:31-01:34
"à quelle heure partez-vous?"

01:34-01:36
"à quelle heure partez-vous?"

01:36-01:37
It's right.

01:37-01:38
Yes.

01:38-01:41
It's curious that...

01:41-01:45
In English we have to introduce a question here, yes?

01:45-01:48
We either use the "are you within?"

01:48-01:49
"Are you leaving?"

01:49-01:50
Yes.

01:50-01:51
"à quelle heure partez-vous?"

01:51-01:52
At what time are you leaving?

01:52-01:54
Or the "do you?"

01:54-01:55
"à quelle heure partez-vous?"

01:55-01:56
At what time do you leave?

01:56-01:57
Yes.

01:57-02:02
For instance, "to stay" is rest-stay.

02:02-02:05
"to rest and stay."

02:05-02:06
Rest-stay.

02:06-02:08
How would you spell rest-stay?

02:08-02:10
R-E-S-T-E-R.

02:10-02:11
Right.

02:11-02:12
R-E-S-T-E-R.

02:12-02:13
Yes.

02:13-02:16
"You are staying" would be?

02:16-02:18
"Vu rest-stay."

02:18-02:19
"Vu rest-stay."

02:19-02:20
"Vu rest-stay."

02:20-02:21
Spelled?

02:21-02:22
R-E-S-T-E-Z.

02:22-02:23
Right.

02:23-02:24
R-E-S-T-E-Z.

02:24-02:36
And for "I", "I am staying," you just drop the "R."

02:36-02:41
And so what will you have for "I am staying?"

02:41-02:46
"Rest-stay."

02:46-02:47
"Rest-stay."

02:47-02:48
"Rest-stay."

02:48-02:49
"Rest-stay."

02:49-02:50
Yes.

02:50-02:55
So whether for "I" or "he" or "she" or "it," it's the same "rest-stay."

02:55-02:57
"Yes."

02:57-02:58
"Je rest-stay."

02:58-03:00
"He is staying" would be "il."

03:00-03:01
"Il" is "he."

03:01-03:02
"He is staying?"

03:02-03:03
"Il rest."

03:03-03:04
"Hm?"

03:04-03:05
"Il rest."

03:05-03:06
"Il rest."

03:06-03:07
"She is "elle."

03:07-03:12
"She is staying" would be "il rest."

03:12-03:13
"Il rest."

03:13-03:14
"Il rest."

03:14-03:15
"My friend is staying.

03:15-03:16
Mon ami."

03:16-03:18
"Mon ami rest."

03:18-03:19
"Right.

03:19-03:20
Mon ami rest."

03:20-03:21
"Yes."

03:21-03:25
"Everybody is to le monde."

03:25-03:27
"All the world."

03:27-03:29
"To le monde."

03:29-03:31
"To" means "all."

03:31-03:33
"Le monde" is "le world."

03:33-03:34
"Monde."

03:34-03:35
"Monde."

03:35-03:37
"How would you spell "mond?"

03:37-03:38
"Monde."

03:38-03:39
"Monde."

03:39-03:40
"Right.

03:40-03:42
Because you sound the "d."

03:42-03:43
"To le monde."

03:43-03:44
"Right.

03:44-03:45
To le monde."

03:45-03:46
"Rest."

03:46-03:47
"To le monde."

03:47-03:48
"Rest."
