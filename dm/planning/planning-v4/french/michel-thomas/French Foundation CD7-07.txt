Expli...

00:06-00:09
Explique.

00:09-00:10
Explique, yes.

00:10-00:13
Because explanation is explication.

00:15-00:20
One of the three exceptions of the 1200 ION nouns.

00:20-00:23

To express...

00:59-01:01
The future tense...

01:01-01:03
In French...

01:03-01:06
It's very easy.

01:06-01:07

01:07-01:12
You simply go into the future.

01:12-01:14
Just going.

01:14-01:15
Yes.

01:15-01:16

In English...

01:18-01:19
In English...

01:19-01:20
You have the two options.

01:20-01:21
You can say...

01:21-01:23
I will leave tomorrow.

01:23-01:24
Or...

01:24-01:26
I'm going to leave tomorrow.

01:26-01:31
In French...

01:31-01:32
The going part...

01:32-01:35
Is used more than in English.

01:35-01:36
You always save...

01:36-01:38
Just using going.

01:39-01:42
So I will do it tomorrow would be...

01:42-01:44

It's a very easy way to express the future.

03:45-03:52
Of course there's another way to express the future.

03:52-04:04
In the very beginnings of the French language, when they use the future, they try to express

04:04-04:12
the future tense, they would say, for I will leave tomorrow, they would say, I to leave have tomorrow.

04:12-04:13
What is I have?

04:13-04:16
J'ai.

04:16-04:16
J'ai.

04:17-04:19
So just have of I is...

04:19-04:20
A.

04:20-04:20
A.

04:20-04:20
A.

04:20-04:21
Yes.

04:21-04:22
A-I.

04:22-04:22
A.

04:22-04:23
Yes.

04:23-04:26
So I to leave have would be...

04:26-04:28
Je partir...

04:28-04:30
Je partir...

04:30-04:31
A.

04:31-04:31
Right.

04:31-04:32
Je partir...

04:32-04:33
A.

04:33-04:34
Demain.

04:34-04:37
