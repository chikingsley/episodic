00:00-00:02
It will start soon.

00:02-00:07
Ça commencera bientôt.

00:07-00:08
Right.

00:08-00:11
Ça commencera bientôt.

00:11-00:18
So actually, you have options.

00:18-00:25
You can always go into the future and say,

00:25-00:27
for it will start soon.

00:28-00:36
Ça va commencer bientôt.

00:36-00:42
Ça va commencer bientôt.

00:42-00:44
Ça va commencer bientôt.

00:44-00:46
It is going to start soon.

00:46-00:48
Ça va commencer bientôt.

00:48-00:53
Or, pense-moi, down the way.

00:53-00:57
Ça commencera bientôt.

00:57-00:58
Right.

00:58-00:59
Ça commencera bientôt.

00:59-01:14
Actually, in French, unlike in English, you have three options to express the future tense.

01:14-01:16
In English, you have two.

01:18-01:21
You can say it is going to start soon.

01:21-01:21
You can say it is going to start soon.

01:21-01:23
It will start soon in English.

01:23-01:24
Yes.

01:24-01:29
In French, again, the going part is used more than in English.

01:30-01:30
Ça va commencer bientôt.

01:30-01:31
Ça va commencer bientôt.

01:31-01:31
Fine.

01:31-01:34
Ça commencera bientôt.

01:34-01:44
The third option in French is simply using the present tense to express the future.

01:46-01:50
It is correct French to say it starts tomorrow.

01:50-01:52
It is starting tomorrow.

01:52-01:55
So, it starts tomorrow would be...

01:55-01:57
Ça commence demain.

01:57-01:57
Right.

01:57-01:59
Ça commence demain.

01:59-01:59
Right.

01:59-02:00
Ça commence demain.

02:00-02:03
So, for instance, to say...

02:03-02:10
So, next week would be...

02:10-02:11
The week is la semaine.

02:11-02:12
The week is la semaine.

02:12-02:19
And the week approaching is next week, la semaine prochaine.

02:19-02:23
La semaine prochaine means next week.

02:25-02:30
So, you can say, I'm going to see you next week, which would be...

02:30-02:39
Je vais vous voir la semaine prochaine.

02:39-02:40
Right.

02:40-02:42
Je vais vous voir la semaine prochaine.

02:42-02:51
But you can also say correctly in French, I see you next week, which is incorrect English.

02:52-02:56
But correct French, I see you would be...

02:56-02:57
Je vais...

02:57-02:57
Je vais...

02:57-02:58
Je vais...

02:58-02:58
Je vous...

02:58-02:59
Je vous vois...

02:59-03:00
Je vous vois...

03:00-03:01
Je vous vois...

03:01-03:02
La...

03:02-03:03
La semaine...

03:03-03:05
La semaine...

03:05-03:05
Proch...

03:05-03:06
Prochaine.

03:06-03:07
Right.

03:07-03:10
Je vous vois la semaine prochaine.

03:10-03:10
Prochaine.

03:10-03:10
Yes.

03:10-03:14
That is correct French.

03:14-03:22
It's so correct that you may have noticed, you may have noticed, speaking to French people,

03:22-03:24
and those who have a good...

03:24-03:31
A seemingly good command of English, you may have noticed how often they will use the present

03:31-03:32
tense in English.

03:32-03:33
Yes.

03:33-03:36
They will say in English, I see you next week.

03:36-03:38
I talk to you later.

03:38-03:38
Yes.

03:38-03:40
I call you tomorrow.

03:40-03:43
They will use the present tense in English.

03:43-03:43
Yeah.

03:43-03:46
Not that they don't know the future tense, which is easy in English.

03:47-03:47
Yes.

03:47-03:56
But their own speech pattern, their own French speech pattern, is in the present tense to

03:56-03:57
express the future.

03:57-04:03
They don't see why it shouldn't be as correct in English as it is in French to use the present

04:03-04:04
tense.

04:04-04:09
That is the reason why you will hear French people say, I see you next week.

04:10-04:11
I talk to you tomorrow.

04:11-04:13
I call you next week, and so on.

04:13-04:14
Yes.

04:14-04:16
Because it is correct French.

04:16-04:17
Yes.

04:17-04:28
So, but, you know, it's a safe way just to go into the future, just using egoing, because

04:28-04:30
that gives you time to think also.

04:30-04:31
Yes.

04:31-04:42
Now, to lift, to lift up, is lever.

04:42-04:43
Lever.

04:43-04:44
Lever.

04:44-04:45
Not L-E-V.

04:45-04:45
Lever.

04:45-04:46
Yes.

04:46-04:46
Levitate.

04:46-04:47
Lever.

04:47-04:48
Yes.

04:48-04:48
Lever.

04:48-04:50
L-E-V-E-R.

04:50-04:51
Lever.

04:51-04:57
So, I'm lifting it would be, je le lever.

04:57-04:58
Lever.

04:58-05:06
In the present tense, if it is not we or you, you have to cut.

05:06-05:10
Can you say that again?

05:10-05:13
Lever is to lift.

05:13-05:18
If you say, je lever is I to lift.

05:18-05:20
Lève.

05:20-05:21
Of course.

05:21-05:22
What else?

05:22-05:23
Yes.

05:23-05:24
Yes.

05:24-05:28
So, I'm lifting it would be, je le lève.

05:28-05:29
Je le lève.

05:29-05:30
Right.

05:30-05:31
Je le lève.

05:31-05:32
Je le lève.

05:32-05:34
He's lifting it.

05:34-05:37
Il le lève.

05:37-05:38
He le lève.

05:38-05:39
She's lifting it.

05:39-05:40
Elle la lève.

05:40-05:40
Elle la lève.

05:40-05:41
Yes.

05:41-05:48
I'm starting would be, je commence.

05:48-05:50
Je commence.

05:50-05:51
Yes.

05:51-05:51
Je commence.

05:52-05:53
He is starting.

05:53-05:55
Il commence.

05:55-05:55
Il commence.

05:55-05:58
It is starting.

05:58-06:00
Ça commence.

06:00-06:01
Ça commence.

06:01-06:04
One is starting.

06:04-06:05
One is on.

06:05-06:06
On.

06:06-06:07
Yes.

06:07-06:07
On.

06:07-06:08
Comment.

06:08-06:08
O-N.

06:08-06:11
One is starting would be on.

06:11-06:12
Commence.

06:12-06:13
On commence.

06:13-06:14
Yes.

06:14-06:14
Yes.

06:14-06:15
Yes.

06:15-06:20
So, that O-N is used a lot in French.

06:20-06:25
One can say, well, one is starting now.

06:25-06:25
Yes.

06:25-06:27
On commencement now.

06:27-06:28
Right.

06:28-06:39
Not only that, but in, especially in the spoken language, the O-N is also used to express

06:39-06:50
we, instead of we, instead of nous, one will say, bon, on commence maintenant, meaning we

06:50-06:54
are starting now, instead of nous commençons, on commence.

06:54-07:02
One will say, for instance, on commence.
