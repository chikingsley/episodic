00:00-00:08
Although you may be only vaguely aware of it, English and French are in fact very closely related languages.

00:08-00:13
I think we're all aware of what happened in 1066, or at least most of us are.

00:13-00:27
There was an invasion in Britain into England by the Normans, and the Normans spoke French, and they brought French to the British Isles.

00:29-00:41
As a result of that, it has left a linguistic legacy in English, which is that five or six out of every ten words in English have come into English through French.

00:41-00:49
This gives us a big, big advantage when learning French, if we utilise these words, that is.

00:49-00:57
I mean, frequently that's not the case, but we will be using them here because they are one of the biggest advantages we have as speakers of English.

00:58-01:01
You'll find that these words tend to be the longer ones in English.

01:01-01:06
The shorter words tend to be of Germanic Anglo-Saxon origin.

01:06-01:09
So we have this division in English.

01:09-01:17
Normally, I'd say typically, words, seven or eight letters in length or longer tend to be of French Latin origin,

01:17-01:22
and shorter than that tend typically to be of Germanic Anglo-Saxon origin.

01:22-01:29
What it means is it's very easy to use these longer words for it when English speakers are speaking French.

01:29-01:37
Not only this, but there are also more recent French additions to the English language, which still feel French.

01:38-01:48
For instance, you may be familiar with terms such as c'est la vie, which means that's life.

01:48-01:55
You may also have heard the expression, as we pronounce it, we pronounce it déjà vu.

01:55-01:59
It's a slight mispronunciation in English, but we're familiar with it.

02:00-02:02
Literally, it actually means already seen.

02:02-02:06
So when we say we've got déjà vu, we mean, oh, you know, I feel like I've already seen that before.

02:06-02:09
And there are quite a few expressions, and they're useful too.

02:09-02:15
And we'll be using them where they're relevant to learning and to speak the French language competently.

02:17-02:21
Finally, there's another group of words which are very useful for English speakers.

02:21-02:25
And these words are a group of words that are still expanding.

02:25-02:31
They're English words that have gone into French since the end of the Second World War.

02:31-02:36
And so, um, these may well be familiar to you.

02:36-02:40
For instance, you may be familiar with...

02:40-02:42
Le weekend.

02:43-02:43
Yeah.

02:43-02:46
Le weekend, which I'm sure you can guess what that means.

02:46-02:48
Another one is...

02:48-02:49
Le parking.

02:49-02:51
Can you guess what that means?

02:51-02:56
That's car park, or parking lot if you're from North America.

02:56-02:58
Another one is...

02:58-02:59
Le living.

02:59-03:03
Le living actually means the living room.

03:03-03:09
You'll find that actually a lot of these words that have come into French, they often have bits chopped off.

03:10-03:14
Or, it will be the same as the English, but with ing added on the end.

03:14-03:20
For instance, another example would be...

03:20-03:25
If you saw the word camping written in French...

03:25-03:27
So, it would look like the English word camping written down.

03:27-03:29
What would you think that meant?

03:29-03:30
Would you think it meant camping?

03:33-03:33
Okay.

03:33-03:37
Actually, camping, which correctly pronounced in French is...

03:37-03:37
Camping.

03:37-03:38
Yes.

03:38-03:41
So, you'll see there's a slight pronunciation different.

03:41-03:45
Actually, it's the campsite, or the camping site.

03:45-03:49
So, these changes in the words are something you get used to.

03:49-03:53
But it's easier to remember something like le camping,

03:53-03:58
than it would be a totally foreign word.

03:58-03:59
So, these can be useful.

03:59-04:00
And we'll be using these in the course where relevant.

04:00-04:01
Okay.

04:01-04:01
So, let's go.

04:01-04:02
Thank you.

04:02-04:03
Thank you.

04:03-04:33
Thank you.
