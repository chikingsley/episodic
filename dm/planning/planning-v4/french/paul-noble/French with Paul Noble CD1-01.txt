Welcome to Collins French with Paul Noble. Content copyright Paul Noble 2010.

00:07-00:19
I'm Paul Noble. Over the years I have taught many, many people.

00:19-00:27
Curiously, they have each had much the same story to tell regarding their previous experiences of language learning.

00:27-00:39
As a result, these days when I first start a teaching session, I ask my students to raise their hands if they have had any of the following experiences.

00:39-00:49
Raise your hand, I say, if you studied a language for several years at school but came out unable to really say anything.

00:49-00:57
Or, if you have ever bought a language course and given up around page 30, somewhere around chapter 2.

00:57-01:04
Or, if you have ever felt more confused by a teacher's explanation of the language than by the language itself.

01:04-01:12
Perhaps you've been amazed by just how closely grammar books resemble furniture assembly instructions.

01:12-01:19
Or, you may have felt that you are in fact more or less incapable of learning a foreign language.

01:21-01:26
Invariably, when I ask these questions, all the students soon have at least one hand in the air.

01:26-01:27
And they laugh.

01:27-01:33
They laugh because for some reason, our language learning experiences tend to be very similar.

01:33-01:38
And sadly, these similar experiences tend not to be very good ones.

01:38-01:47
My own initial experiences of language learning were also uncannily similar to those I've just described.

01:48-01:53
In fact, when I ask my students these questions, my own hand is the first to go up.

01:53-01:57
And it stays up until we have gone through them all.

01:57-02:07
However, these less than positive experiences have had an upside both for myself and for those individuals I have taught.

02:07-02:11
Because these experiences, along with a number of other factors,

02:11-02:16
have helped inform and shape the method that will be used during this course.

02:17-02:25
Using this method, you will learn how to communicate in French and how to formulate your own ideas and thoughts using French.

02:25-02:33
As you learn with it, you will quickly discover that I do not use complicated grammatical explanations at all.

02:33-02:37
And I will not ask you to memorise long lists of vocabulary.

02:38-02:42
The way the course is structured will by itself ensure that you remember what you are taught.

02:42-02:49
Instead, through your interaction with the CDs, I will lead you through the French language,

02:49-02:54
enabling you to build up complex sentences by yourself, step by step,

02:54-03:00
so that you are actually speaking independently in French by the end of the course.

03:01-03:05
And this is regardless of how little or how much you know when you begin.

03:05-03:10
You will also discover that the language I teach is designed to be adaptable.

03:10-03:17
So you will be able to use it just as easily for holidaying in a French-speaking country as for living or working in one.

03:17-03:24
It will be just as easy to use it to order a coffee as to hold a conversation with the waiter who brings it to you.

03:25-03:30
And again, all of this regardless of how little or how much you know when you begin.

03:30-03:37
This method has already proved extremely successful with a very great many students,

03:37-03:40
including hundreds of so-called no-hopers.

03:40-03:45
Interestingly, not one of these students failed to learn using this method.

03:47-03:52
It is these many success cases, letters of thank you, and even the occasional hug,

03:52-03:55
that have made teaching languages so very worthwhile for me.

03:55-04:00
And it is this that has persuaded me to publish my courses here for the first time.

04:00-04:08
I anticipate and hope that they will be as effective for you as they have been for so many of my other students.

04:08-04:10
Au revoir and good luck.

04:10-04:11
Thank you.

04:11-04:41
Thank you.
