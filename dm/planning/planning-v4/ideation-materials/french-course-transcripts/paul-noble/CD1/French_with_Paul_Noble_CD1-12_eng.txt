00:00:00,779 --> 00:00:17,479 [Paul Noble]
Now, as we've seen, there clearly are already many groups of words typically decided by word endings that you can easily identify as being of French origin. So words that end in I-O-N, words that end in A-B-L-E, I-B-L-E. 

00:00:17,479 --> 00:00:20,420 [Paul Noble]
We've just had chamber, which in French becomes? 

00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:22,299 [Marion]
Chambre. 

00:00:22,299 --> 00:00:32,399 [Paul Noble]
And there's, there are lots more groups. One of the ones I'm going to introduce now is particularly useful, especially if you want to make a comment about something. 

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:43,259 [Paul Noble]
This group of words come from words in English that end in ic and ical. That's words that end in I-C and I-C-A-L, 

00:00:43,259 --> 00:00:46,579 [Paul Noble]
such as typical, for example. 

00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:51,419 [Paul Noble]
Now, these words in French are ever so slightly different, 

00:00:51,419 --> 00:00:59,999 [Paul Noble]
because instead, instead of ending in ical or ic, they all end in que in French. 

00:00:59,999 --> 00:01:02,140 [Marion]
Que. 

00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:09,439 [Paul Noble]
So how do you think you would say typical? Get rid of the ical and replace it with que. 

00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:11,159 [Marion]
Typique. 

00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:14,959 [Paul Noble]
What about exotic? 

00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:16,740 [Marion]
Exotique. 

00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:19,640 [Paul Noble]
Political? 

00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,560 [Marion]
Politique. 

00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,060 [Paul Noble]
The word for it is in French, it is, is? 

00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:27,539 [Marion]
C'est. 

00:01:27,539 --> 00:01:29,859 [Marion]
C'est. 

00:01:29,859 --> 00:01:36,900 [Paul Noble]
It's quite easy to pronounce. Um, we find a lot of English speakers will often pronounce it as something more like se, 

00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,359 [Paul Noble]
but it's not exactly se, but more? 

00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:41,159 [Marion]
C'est. 

00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:42,339 [Marion]
C'est. 

00:01:42,339 --> 00:01:48,439 [Paul Noble]
So with that in mind, how would you say, "It's typical"? 

00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:50,159 [Marion]
C'est typique. 

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,679 [Paul Noble]
It's exotic? 

00:01:53,679 --> 00:01:55,560 [Marion]
C'est exotique. 

00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,779 [Paul Noble]
It's political. 

00:01:58,779 --> 00:02:04,019 [Marion]
C'est politique. 

00:02:04,019 --> 00:02:27,459 [Paul Noble]
Now, keeping in mind that the A in French is pronounced a little bit like the A in the English word father, so a sort of an uh sound. Not quite as long as the A in father, but more of an uh than an ah. With that in mind, how would you say romantic? 

00:02:27,459 --> 00:02:29,479 [Marion]
Romantique. 

00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:33,799 [Paul Noble]
What about, "It is romantic"? 

00:02:33,799 --> 00:02:35,679 [Marion]
C'est romantique. 

00:02:35,679 --> 00:02:38,919 [Paul Noble]
It's fantastic. 

00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:40,639 [Marion]
C'est fantastique. 

00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:46,519 [Paul Noble]
What about democratic? 

00:02:46,519 --> 00:02:48,059 [Marion]
Démocratique. 

00:02:48,059 --> 00:02:52,400 [Paul Noble]
And, "It's democratic"? 

00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,039 [Marion]
C'est démocratique. 

00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:57,659 [Paul Noble]
Problematic? 

00:02:57,659 --> 00:02:59,220 [Marion]
Problématique. 

00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:02,059 [Paul Noble]
It's problematic. 

00:03:02,059 --> 00:03:05,259 [Marion]
C'est problématique. 

00:03:05,259 --> 00:03:19,619 [Paul Noble]
Again, these words I've found are particularly useful for making comments about things. You can say, "Oh, it's, it's, it's problematic," or, "It's fantastic." Very good for making comments and being able to start engaging in French conversation. 

00:03:19,619 --> 00:03:22,720 [Paul Noble]
Let's go back to, "It's romantic," again. 

00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,279 [Marion]
C'est romantique. 

00:03:24,279 --> 00:03:27,639 [Paul Noble]
And what was because? 

00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:29,679 [Marion]
Parce que. 

00:03:29,679 --> 00:03:44,199 [Paul Noble]
So how would you say, "I would like to reserve a table for dinner, because it's romantic"? Let's start with, "I would like to reserve a table for dinner." 

00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:48,080 [Marion]
Je voudrais réserver une table pour le dîner. 

00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:53,919 [Paul Noble]
Now, you should have remembered when you say, "For dinner," in French you will always say, "For the dinner," which is? 

00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:57,259 [Marion]
Pour le diner. 

00:03:57,259 --> 00:04:04,099 [Paul Noble]
Now let's carry on. "Because it's romantic." 

00:04:04,099 --> 00:04:06,399 [Marion]
Parce que c'est romantique. 

00:04:06,399 --> 00:04:17,179 [Paul Noble]
And from the beginning. "I would like to reserve a table for dinner because it's romantic." 

00:04:17,179 --> 00:04:21,719 [Marion]
Je voudrais réserver une table pour le diner parce que c'est romantique.
