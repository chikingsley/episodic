00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:09,760 [Paul Noble]
How would you say, "I would like to prepare the coffee for you?" 

00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,979 [Marion]
Je voudrais préparer le café pour vous. 

00:00:13,979 --> 00:00:28,159 [Paul Noble]
How would you say, "I would like to prepare roast beef for dinner?" Or as the French would say, "I would like to prepare the roast beef for the dinner." 

00:00:28,159 --> 00:00:32,239 [Marion]
Je voudrais préparer le rosbeef pour le dîner. 

00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:40,540 [Paul Noble]
How about, "I would like to reserve a table"? 

00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,420 [Marion]
Je voudrais réserver une table. 

00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:52,419 [Paul Noble]
"I would like to reserve a table for dinner." 

00:00:52,419 --> 00:00:54,919 [Marion]
Je voudrais réserver une table pour le dîner. 

00:00:54,919 --> 00:01:02,499 [Paul Noble]
Now again, make sure when you say for dinner in French that you say for the dinner. 

00:01:02,499 --> 00:01:09,060 [Paul Noble]
Because the French will always say, for the dinner. They will never just say, for dinner, which would be- 

00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,459 [Marion]
Pour dîner 

00:01:10,459 --> 00:01:12,779 [Paul Noble]
But rather they will say, for the dinner, which is? 

00:01:12,779 --> 00:01:14,839 [Marion]
Pour le dîner. 

00:01:14,839 --> 00:01:31,279 [Paul Noble]
Now, we've obviously encountered some words in English that are... That we can use in French very easily such as the words that end in I-O-N. Um, words like table that end in A-B-L-E, and their cousins, the words that end in I-B-L-E. 

00:01:31,279 --> 00:01:46,899 [Paul Noble]
But there are actually many, many thousands of words and they're easy to identify by the word endings. For instance, let's have a look at a very simple word in English. Let's take the word room in English. 

00:01:46,899 --> 00:01:55,079 [Paul Noble]
Now, is room a long or a short word? 

00:01:55,079 --> 00:02:05,439 [Paul Noble]
And does it sound Germanic or French? Perhaps you don't know at this stage. 

00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:21,299 [Paul Noble]
As I mentioned at the beginning, the short words in English tend to be of Germanic Anglo-Saxon origin. So, a word like room is more likely than not to have come from the Germanic part of the language. 

00:02:21,299 --> 00:02:37,359 [Paul Noble]
So, if we want to find what the word for room is in French we can look in other areas of English and see if there's an alternative, perhaps a longer word. Perhaps it's not used as much. But we can use tricks like this to find vocabulary. 

00:02:37,359 --> 00:03:07,419 [Paul Noble]
And as I've often said to people before, it's much easier [laughs] to invent vocabulary than to memorize it. If you can invent it, you can invent thousands of words. If you memorize, it takes weeks to learn a hundred. Um, now let's think about those words we do have for room in English. For instance, we can say bedroom in English but there's also a more old-fashioned way to refer to the bedroom. Perhaps you can think of an example. 

00:03:07,419 --> 00:03:12,459 [Paul Noble]
If you're not able to get it by yourself, I'll give you some help. 

00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:21,299 [Paul Noble]
For instance, perhaps, um, even now one t- talks about something like the queen's bed chamber, rather than the queen's bedroom. 

00:03:21,299 --> 00:03:40,299 [Paul Noble]
And so, we also have the word chamber, that means for room, rather than simply using room. We use it less often but it does exist in English. Again, as I've ti- as I've said, typically short words are Germanic, longer words are French. So, we have chamber in English. 

00:03:40,299 --> 00:03:46,959 [Paul Noble]
Now, this leads us to another useful rule. Words that end in -amber in English 

00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:51,679 [Paul Noble]
generally exist in French, except the amber becomes? 

00:03:51,679 --> 00:03:53,439 [Marion]
Ambre. 

00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:56,399 [Paul Noble]
And actually the word for amber in French is? 

00:03:56,399 --> 00:03:58,059 [Marion]
Ambre. 

00:03:58,059 --> 00:04:04,159 [Paul Noble]
With that in mind, how do you think you would say chamber in French? 

00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,799 [Marion]
Chambre. 

00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:08,939 [Paul Noble]
You'll notice also that the ch- 

00:04:08,939 --> 00:04:15,379 [Paul Noble]
is pronounced sh- in French, as you may have already said. So again, chamber in French is? 

00:04:15,379 --> 00:04:16,359 [Marion]
Chambre. 

00:04:16,359 --> 00:04:19,179 [Paul Noble]
Which means room. 

00:04:19,179 --> 00:04:28,959 [Paul Noble]
With that in mind, how would you say, "I would like to reserve a room?" 

00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:32,219 [Marion]
Je voudrais réserver une chambre. 

00:04:32,219 --> 00:04:40,279 [Paul Noble]
Or if you'd like you can simply say, "I would like a room," which would be? 

00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:42,999 [Marion]
Je voudrais une chambre. 

00:04:42,999 --> 00:04:46,359 [Paul Noble]
Good. 

00:04:46,359 --> 00:04:48,239 [Paul Noble]
A person in French is? 

00:04:48,239 --> 00:04:51,919 [Marion]
Une personne. 

00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,119 [Paul Noble]
The word for two in French is? 

00:04:54,119 --> 00:04:56,139 [Marion]
Deux. 

00:04:56,139 --> 00:05:02,819 [Paul Noble]
So, how do you think you would say two people in French? Literally, two persons. 

00:05:02,819 --> 00:05:04,679 [Marion]
Deux personnes. 

00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:12,619 [Paul Noble]
Again, you'll notice that even though there's two of them we don't make the sound of an S at the end. One person is? 

00:05:12,619 --> 00:05:13,939 [Marion]
Une personne. 

00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:15,699 [Paul Noble]
And two people in French are? 

00:05:15,699 --> 00:05:17,219 [Marion]
Deux personnes. 

00:05:17,219 --> 00:05:31,479 [Paul Noble]
Now, in the French there is an S at the end, but remember, in French we don't pronounce the consonant at the end of a word unless it's in for luck. An S is not in for luck. 

00:05:31,479 --> 00:05:36,039 [Paul Noble]
So, keeping in mind that two people in French, two persons, are pronounced as- 

00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:37,479 [Marion]
Deux personnes. 

00:05:37,479 --> 00:05:45,679 [Paul Noble]
How would you say, "I would like a room for two people?" 

00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:50,039 [Marion]
Je voudrais une chambre pour deux personnes. 

00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:54,019 [Paul Noble]
A night in French, a night as in one night, is? 

00:05:54,019 --> 00:05:55,759 [Marion]
Une nuit. 

00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:00,639 [Paul Noble]
So, to say two nights would be? 

00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:03,379 [Marion]
Deux nuits. 

00:06:03,379 --> 00:06:14,799 [Paul Noble]
How would you say, "I would like a room for two people for two nights?" 

00:06:14,799 --> 00:06:20,599 [Marion]
Je voudrais une chambre pour deux personnes pour deux nuits. 

00:06:20,599 --> 00:06:37,019 [Paul Noble]
Again, make sure that when you say it you say, "I would like a room for two people for two nights." Let's do that one more time. 

00:06:37,019 --> 00:06:40,959 [Marion]
Je voudrais une chambre pour deux personnes pour deux nuits.
