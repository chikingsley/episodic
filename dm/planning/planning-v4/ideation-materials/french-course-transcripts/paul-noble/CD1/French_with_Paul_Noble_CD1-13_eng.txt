00:00:00,859 --> 00:00:21,159 [Paul Noble]
So, we've been using I would like, which is very useful, but of course you're going to want to sometimes ask someone else what it is they would like or what it is they would want. So let's move on and start asking someone else what, what they want. You may already be familiar with the way to say do you want in French, which is... 

00:00:21,159 --> 00:00:23,479 [Marion]
Voulez-vous. 

00:00:23,479 --> 00:00:25,039 [Marion]
Voulez-vous. 

00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:33,799 [Paul Noble]
There's a few songs that have it in. If you've heard Abba [laughs], you may, you may be familiar with it. There's also some other people who use t- that term. 

00:00:33,799 --> 00:00:41,459 [Paul Noble]
Um, how would you say, "Do you want to reserve a table?" 

00:00:41,459 --> 00:00:44,459 [Marion]
Voulez-vous rÃ©server une table? 

00:00:44,459 --> 00:00:47,139 [Paul Noble]
To visit in French is... 

00:00:47,139 --> 00:00:48,879 [Marion]
Visiter. 

00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:50,279 [Marion]
Visiter. 

00:00:50,279 --> 00:00:59,679 [Paul Noble]
Again, simply th- there are those I-O-N words like visitation in English, where you cut off the -ation, you add E-R, and you have to visit. 

00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:07,399 [Paul Noble]
So how would you say, "I would like to visit the park"? 

00:01:07,399 --> 00:01:09,779 [Marion]
Je voudrais visiter le parc. 

00:01:09,779 --> 00:01:18,659 [Paul Noble]
How would you say, "Do you want to visit the park?" 

00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:22,039 [Marion]
Voulez-vous visiter le parc? 

00:01:22,039 --> 00:01:28,639 [Paul Noble]
How about, "I would like to visit the Louvre." 

00:01:28,639 --> 00:01:30,179 [Marion]
Je voudrais visiter le Louvre. 

00:01:30,179 --> 00:01:35,279 [Paul Noble]
"Do you want to visit the Louvre?" 

00:01:35,279 --> 00:01:39,539 [Marion]
Voulez-vous visiter le Louvre? 

00:01:39,539 --> 00:01:42,319 [Paul Noble]
To know in French is... 

00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:45,679 [Marion]
Savoir. Savoir. 

00:01:45,679 --> 00:01:51,039 [Paul Noble]
How would you say, "I would like to know"? 

00:01:51,039 --> 00:01:53,499 [Marion]
Je voudrais savoir. 

00:01:53,499 --> 00:01:57,279 [Paul Noble]
The word for if in French is... 

00:01:57,279 --> 00:01:58,599 [Marion]
Si. Si. 

00:01:58,599 --> 00:02:07,319 [Paul Noble]
How would you say, "I would like to know if it's romantic"? So from the beginning. I would like to know. 

00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:09,559 [Marion]
Je voudrais savoir. 

00:02:09,559 --> 00:02:13,759 [Paul Noble]
If it's romantic. 

00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:17,199 [Marion]
Si c'est romantique. 

00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:20,979 [Paul Noble]
Again, so the word for if is... 

00:02:20,979 --> 00:02:22,579 [Marion]
Si. 

00:02:22,579 --> 00:02:24,919 [Paul Noble]
And the word for it is, is... 

00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:26,559 [Marion]
C'est. 

00:02:26,559 --> 00:02:32,119 [Paul Noble]
So you can see they sound a bit similar, but you'll get used to them as we go on. So again, if is... 

00:02:32,119 --> 00:02:33,579 [Marion]
Si. 

00:02:33,579 --> 00:02:34,819 [Paul Noble]
But it is, is... 

00:02:34,819 --> 00:02:36,139 [Marion]
C'est. 

00:02:36,139 --> 00:02:48,419 [Paul Noble]
The if sounds a bit more like the C that you would swim in, a little bit like that, but shorter. And the it is sounds a bit more like the English word say, but it's not pronounced as clearly as that. 

00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:58,479 [Paul Noble]
But that's the difference, one veers more towards C and the other towards say. But again, there are no exact equivalents because it's a different language. 

00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:00,419 [Paul Noble]
So again, one more time, if is... 

00:03:00,419 --> 00:03:01,339 [Marion]
Si. 

00:03:01,339 --> 00:03:02,459 [Paul Noble]
And it is, is... 

00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:04,499 [Marion]
C'est. 

00:03:04,499 --> 00:03:08,879 [Paul Noble]
Let's move onto another word now. The word for but in French is... 

00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,759 [Marion]
Mais. 

00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:12,519 [Marion]
Mais. 

00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:22,859 [Paul Noble]
So how would you say, "I would like a room for two people for two nights, but I'd like to know if it's romantic" 

00:03:22,859 --> 00:03:26,559 [Paul Noble]
We'll start at the beginning so that you can remember it all. 

00:03:26,559 --> 00:03:31,539 [Paul Noble]
Um, start with, "I would like a room." 

00:03:31,539 --> 00:03:33,639 [Marion]
Je voudrais une chambre. 

00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:38,119 [Paul Noble]
For two people, for two persons. 

00:03:38,119 --> 00:03:41,339 [Marion]
Pour deux personnes. 

00:03:41,339 --> 00:03:45,879 [Paul Noble]
For two nights. 

00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:48,159 [Marion]
Pour deux nuits. 

00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:51,179 [Paul Noble]
But. 

00:03:51,179 --> 00:03:53,039 [Marion]
Mais. 

00:03:53,039 --> 00:04:02,519 [Paul Noble]
I would like to know if it's romantic. 

00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:06,539 [Marion]
Je voudrais savoir si c'est romantique. 

00:04:06,539 --> 00:04:22,499 [Paul Noble]
Now put the whole thing together. I would like a room for two people, for two nights, but I'd like to know if it's romantic. 

00:04:22,499 --> 00:04:34,319 [Marion]
Je voudrais une chambre pour deux personnes, pour deux nuits, mais je voudrais savoir si c'est romantique. 

00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:37,779 [Narrator]
