Congratulations! You have just finished an introduction, a very exciting introduction, to a language.

00:09-00:21
It gives you practical and functional use of the language in such a short period of time, in a matter of hours and not weeks or months or years.

00:21-00:44
And it also gave you enough very useful vocabulary and more than that, an understanding of language, an understanding of how to formulate not only your own thoughts and express yourself, not in memorized sentences,

00:44-01:13
but also give you a sense of vocabulary, a sense of making a distinction between the richness of the English language that consists of Germanic, Anglo-Saxon, and French, Spanish, Italian, and to know and to have discovered how you can guess what in English is,

01:13-01:27
what is of Anglo-Saxon origin and what is of French and Latin origin, which gives you a vocabulary of thousands of words.

01:27-01:51
There should be no problem for you to express yourself and to experience the excitement of being able to express yourself in another language and in the use of the language in conversation and also reading to see how you can enlarge your vocabulary and get more and more excited about it.

01:51-02:03
I hope that it will have given you great excitement and the experience of learning that can be applied, not only to language learning, but to all learning.

02:03-02:08
And I want to share that with you because it gives me excitement.

02:08-02:10
Thank you.

02:10-02:14
End of recording eight.
