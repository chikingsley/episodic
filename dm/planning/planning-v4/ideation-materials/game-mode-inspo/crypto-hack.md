# Crypto Hack

**Crypto Hack** was released on May 18th, 2021 during Season 2 and can only be played by hosting. The point is to answer questions while stealing Crypto from other players. It is similar to Gold Quest/Candy Quest, Shamrock Quest, Santa’s Workshop and Deceptive Dinos, but it doesn’t include swapping or losing your Crypto. You need to answer questions correctly to obtain Crypto, or to hack others by guessing their password to steal their Crypto. All Bot Pack Blooks are in Crypto Hack, including Owl (Judgemental Owl), Toucan (Tax Toucan) and Spooky Ghost as a password select.

At the start of the game, you will get a choice of five different passwords. After choosing, you can start answering questions. If you get a question correct, then you will get a choice of three random outputs that are hidden, but if you get a question incorrect, then nothing happens, and you move on to the next question.

Crypto Hack gives you 0.25 tokens per question.

## Passwords

There are multiple different passwords you can choose, below is a list of some of them;

* 2+2=4
* LeaveMeAlone
* MooooMoooo74
* x_MagicalWizard_x

## Abilities and Blooks

There are 8 abilities that can be obtained while playing this game, represented in Blooks:

* Nothing! (No Crypto)
* +10 Crypto
* +20 Crypto
* +30 Crypto
* +50 Crypto
* Double Crypto
* Triple Crypto
* HACK (Hacks a random player)

## Strategy

Since this game mode is heavily reliant on luck, speed, and insight, the "best" strategy would be to remember **everything**.

Remember all possible options for someone's password, and if you fail and get the opportunity to hack again, it will show the right password for the second time.

## Trivia

* The Crypto currency is most likely inspired from Bitcoin, which uses crypto to and the same symbol to each other too.
* Unlike Gold Quest or Candy Quest, there’s no option to lose your crypto by a percentage. You lose crypto when your opponent guesses your password successfully and takes your crypto.
* There is also no option to swap crypto.
* Toucan, Owl and Spooky Ghost are the only non Bot Pack Blooks in the game (But as a password select).
* This is the only Game Mode with an introduction, where it welcome players to the Terminal Hacking Portal to select a password before we get to play the quiz.
* Watson is the only Bot Pack Blook that gives you 0 crypto.
* The currency in this game mode is quite identical to Blooket tokens from the Market.
* The music that plays during this game mode is "The Spacex Cyberpunk" by Yuri Petrovski.
* This is currently the only pack that mentions a mystical, which is Spooky Ghost.
* Crypto Hack is one of the 6 game modes that have at least 1 Mystical Blook which is Spooky Ghost. The others are Tower Defense, Santa's Workshop, Halloween version Monster Brawl, Fishing Frenzy and Cafe.
* The password "TheCakeIsALie" is a reference to a YouTube video created by SMG4, a YouTuber who makes YTPs.
* 10 seconds are used up in the loading screen when you start the game, so if your game is 7 minutes long, players will only get 6 minutes and 50 seconds to play.
