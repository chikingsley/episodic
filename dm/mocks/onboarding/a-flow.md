# Dark Mallard Onboarding Flow

Here's a recap of the complete onboarding sequence we've designed for the Dark Mallard language learning app:

## 1. Encrypted Transmission Screen / Video
The initial screen users see when launching the app. It features the Dark Mallard logo with a "Language Acquisition Division" subtitle, surrounded by a tactical frame. A scan line effect moves across the screen, and a "CLASSIFIED" stamp appears in the corner. The screen displays "INCOMING TRANSMISSION" and explains that the user has been identified as a potential asset for language acquisition operations. An "ACCEPT TRANSMISSION" button at the bottom guides users to the next screen.

## 2. Recruitment Pitch Screen / Video
This screen shows a simulated video feed of "Commandant Renard" (represented by a silhouette) delivering a briefing. Text gradually appears in a terminal-style interface below the video, explaining that the Network is seeking agents with language acquisition potential for covert operations. Users can choose to "ACCEPT MISSION" or "DECLINE" with two buttons at the bottom.

## 3. Language Selection Screen
A simplified tactical interface where users select their target language from options like French, Spanish, Italian, German, and Japanese. Each language is presented as an "operation" (e.g., "OPERATION RIVIERA" for French). A small tactical map visualization highlights the selected region. Once a language is selected, a confirmation message appears: "LANGUAGE TARGET CONFIRMED" followed by "ESTABLISHING SECURE CONNECTION..."

## 4. Skill Assessment Screen
Users select their current proficiency level in the chosen language, presented as security clearance levels:
- LEVEL 0: No prior knowledge
- LEVEL 1: Basic phrases only
- LEVEL 2: Elementary proficiency
- LEVEL 3: Professional proficiency
- LEVEL 4: Native/Bilingual
Each option displays a security clearance designation (e.g., "RESTRICTED", "CONFIDENTIAL", "SECRET").

## 5. Mission Motivation Screen
Users select their primary motivation for language learning, framed as mission parameters:
- INFILTRATION (Travel)
- ASSET CULTIVATION (Meeting people)
- DEEP COVER (Living abroad)
- INTELLIGENCE ANALYSIS (Business/Career)
- PERSONAL INTEREST (Just for fun)
Each option includes a specialized icon and tactical description.

## 6. Training Simulation Screen
A mini-lesson that introduces basic vocabulary through a tactical training format:
- Introduction explaining the training protocol
- Multiple-choice vocabulary questions testing basic French terms
- Dialogue simulation with appropriate responses
- Completion screen showing XP earned and accuracy rating
Progress is tracked through steps at the top of the screen, and feedback is provided for each answer.

## 7. Commitment Protocol Screen
Users select their daily training commitment, presented as operational roles:
- 7 DAY STREAK - "Initial field readiness threshold" (GOOD)
- 14 DAY STREAK - "Standard operational persistence" (GREAT)
- 30 DAY STREAK - "Advanced field commitment protocol" (INCREDIBLE)
- 50 DAY STREAK - "Elite agent operational consistency" (UNSTOPPABLE)
A calendar visualization shows the weekly commitment pattern based on selection.

## 8. Agent Registration Screen
Users create their account, framed as establishing secure communication:
- Email field labeled as "COMMUNICATION CHANNEL"
- Password field as "ACCESS PROTOCOL"
- Age verification as "SECURITY CLEARANCE VERIFICATION"
- Optional username as "FIELD OPERATIVE DESIGNATION"
Alternative sign-in options are available below.

## 9. Mission Control Introduction
An introduction to the main app interface with a tutorial overlay:
- Brief loading animation as Mission Control initializes
- Simple app interface mockup showing key elements
- Tutorial highlights pointing out features like "ACTIVE MISSION", "INTELLIGENCE", etc.
- Final welcome message confirming the user is ready to begin operations

The entire flow maintains the spy/tactical aesthetic with consistent design elements:
- Dark background with red accents
- Military-style terminology
- Scanning line effects and visual "glitches"
- Classified document stamps and tactical map elements
- Monospaced fonts and angular design elements

This comprehensive onboarding sequence transforms the standard app setup process into an immersive spy recruitment narrative that introduces users to both the app's functionality and its unique thematic approach to language learning.
