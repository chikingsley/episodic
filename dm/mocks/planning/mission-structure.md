# EPISODIC - Language Learning Mission Structure

## Core Concept

EPISODIC combines language learning with an immersive spy narrative where each lesson becomes part of a covert operation. Language acquisition isn't just academic—it's mission-critical for field operations. Every vocabulary word, grammar rule, and conversation practice has immediate practical application within the narrative.

## Mission Flow

### 1. Intelligence Gathering

**Purpose:** Introduce key vocabulary and basic concepts needed for the mission.

**Implementation:**
- Presented as a series of "intel reports" that contain essential vocabulary
- User must review and demonstrate basic understanding of terms
- Completion unlocks the main mission briefing
- Utilizes spaced repetition for words flagged as "critical intel"

**UI Elements:**
- Intel files that open to reveal vocabulary sets
- "Classified" stamps that reveal translations when tapped
- Progress tracker showing "intel decoded: 7/12"
- Audio recordings of native pronunciation

**Example:**
> "Agent, we've intercepted communications about operation 'Café Rendezvous.' Before your deployment, you need to familiarize yourself with these key terms. Security level: Red-3."

### 2. Mission Briefing

**Purpose:** Establish narrative context and clear objectives for the language learning mission.

**Implementation:**
- Short animated cutscene or visual novel style interaction
- Introduction of mission parameters and success criteria
- Introduces the "handler" character who guides the user
- Sets up the scenario (e.g., "infiltrate the café and identify the contact")

**UI Elements:**
- Character portraits with dialog boxes
- Mission objectives displayed as checklist
- Location imagery establishing the setting
- Interactive dialog options (basic)

**Example:**
> "Your mission is to make contact with asset 'Blue Jay' at Café Lumière in Cannes. You'll need to order a coffee, engage in small talk, and extract the target's hometown without raising suspicion. Cover identity: Canadian tourist."

### 3. Field Training

**Purpose:** The core language learning content - structured lessons with clear application to mission goals.

**Implementation:**
- Series of lesson cards (vocabulary, dialogues, videos, quizzes)
- Each lesson directly connected to mission objectives
- Combined approach of explicit teaching and immersive context
- Progressive difficulty building toward mission success

**Lesson Types:**
- **Cover Training:** Basic vocabulary and phrases (presented as maintaining cover identity)
- **Tactical Communications:** Dialogues and conversations (with mission-relevant contexts)
- **Field Recordings:** Video content showing native speakers in relevant scenarios
- **Scenario Simulations:** Practice exercises with feedback

**UI Elements:**
- Lesson cards with mission-relevance indicators
- Progress tracker showing readiness for field operation
- Performance metrics (accuracy, comprehension, speed)
- Optional hints and assistance (presented as "handler support")

**Example:**
> "Today's training will focus on café vocabulary and ordering etiquette. Your ability to naturally order 'un café' could be the difference between mission success and blown cover."

### 4. Field Operation

**Purpose:** Apply learned language in an interactive scenario that tests comprehension and production.

**Implementation:**
- Interactive dialogue simulation where user must select appropriate responses
- Recognition of audio cues and appropriate responses
- Time-pressure elements for realism (optional difficulty setting)
- Multiple paths to success with varying degrees of "cover effectiveness"

**Mechanics:**
- Dialogue tree with multiple response options
- Audio recognition for pronunciation practice (optional)
- Hidden success metrics (did you use formal/informal appropriately? did you maintain cover?)
- Ability to use "emergency extraction" (hints) at cost of mission effectiveness

**UI Elements:**
- Immersive scenario visuals (café interior, street scene, etc.)
- Character portraits with speech bubbles
- Timed response indicators
- "Cover status" meter showing how natural you appear

**Example Interactive Dialog:**
```
Waiter: "Bonjour monsieur, vous désirez?"
[User must select appropriate greeting and order]
1. "Bonjour, je voudrais un café s'il vous plaît."
2. "Give me coffee."
3. "Excuse me, do you speak English?"
```

### 5. Mission Debrief

**Purpose:** Review performance, reinforce learning, and set up progression to next mission.

**Implementation:**
- Performance review with specific feedback on language use
- Highlights of successful interactions and areas for improvement
- SRS scheduling of vocabulary that needs reinforcement
- Rewards and progression unlocks

**UI Elements:**
- Mission success rating (S-A-B-C rank)
- Detailed breakdown of language performance
- XP and level progression indicators
- "Classified" next mission teaser

**Example:**
> "Mission status: SUCCESS. Cover maintained at 82% effectiveness. Your greeting was natural, but hesitation when discussing hometown raised minor suspicion. Intel gathered has been added to your database. New language assets unlocked."

## Progression System

### XP and Leveling

- Experience points earned through all activities
- Level progression unlocks new missions and capabilities
- Daily objectives provide bonus XP opportunities
- Streak maintenance increases XP multipliers

### Clearance Levels

- Completing missions increases security clearance
- Higher clearance unlocks more complex missions and language content
- Clearance levels tie directly to language proficiency (Level 1: A1 beginner, etc.)
- Special "classification" unlocks for exceptional performance

### Skill Specializations

- Users can develop specializations based on their focus:
  - **Field Operative:** Conversation and pronunciation focus
  - **Intelligence Analyst:** Reading and vocabulary focus
  - **Communications Expert:** Listening and comprehension focus
- Specializations provide bonuses to certain mission types

## Hub Interface Elements

## Technical Implementation Priorities

1. Core mission loop functionality
2. SRS system for vocabulary retention
3. Interactive dialogue system for field operations
4. Progress tracking and achievement system
5. Narrative content creation
6. Audio integration for pronunciation

## Design Philosophy

The design should maintain the spy theme as an engaging wrapper around solid language learning principles:

1. **Meaningful Context:** All vocabulary and grammar taught within realistic scenarios
2. **Clear Progression:** Visible path from beginner to advanced
3. **Immediate Application:** Skills learned are immediately used in field operations
4. **Spaced Repetition:** Critical vocabulary is reinforced through "intel reviews"
5. **Engagement First:** Fun experience that happens to teach language effectively

The spy narrative should enhance rather than distract from language acquisition, providing motivation and context that makes learning feel purposeful and exciting.
