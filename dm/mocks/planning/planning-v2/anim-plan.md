# Operation: Dark Mallard - Animation Plan

## I. Intro Sequence (Pre-Mission Briefing)

### Visual

Black screen with a blinking cursor.

### Text Sequence (On Screen)

- `> DEVICE INITIALIZATION...`
- `> SECURE PROTOCOL ACTIVATED`
- `> IDENTIFYING OPERATIVE... [Scanning animation]`
- `> WELCOME AGENT [Random code name]`
- `> OPERATION: DARK MALLARD`
- `> LOCATION: [French city - Marseille or Lyon] ACQUIRED`
- `> DIRECTIVE: INFILTRATE AND EXTRACT`
- `> MISSION BRIEFING IMMINENT...`

### Visual (Map)

Tactical map of France appears, highlighting the target city.

## II. Mission Briefing (On Plane)

### Briefing Setting

Interior of a dimly lit aircraft cabin.

### Character

Dark Mallard (Handler/Instructor figure).

### Dialogue (Dark Mallard)

- "Listen up, rookie. In 15 minutes you'll be on French soil. Your mission: infiltrate local government networks, gather intelligence on Project Dauphine."
- "Your cover is an American tourist - thin, but it's all we've got. Problem is, you don't speak a word of French."
- [Dark Mallard holds up the secure device] "This device will be your lifeline. But if it's discovered with an English interface? Mission compromised."
- "We're implementing French language protocols now. Each day, more interface elements will be localized. By mission end, your device should be indistinguishable from a local's."

## III. Initial Training & Device Localization (Pre-Landing)

### Activity

Mini-game simulating language learning (like Duolingo/Pimsleur) focused on device UI elements.

### UI Changes (Examples)

- "Settings" → "Paramètres"
- "Mission" → "Mission" (Note pronunciation difference)
- "Profile" → "Profil"

### Concept

Introduce the core mechanic of language learning tied to game progression/UI changes.

## IV. Arrival & Airport Encounter (The First Test)

### Airport Setting

Airport arrivals/customs area. Bustling, official atmosphere.

### Airport Objective

Navigate basic customs check using practiced phrases.

### Pre-Encounter Training (Briefing Flashback/Device Prompt)

- "Okay, rookie. Standard procedure at customs. Keep it simple. We have assets in place, but stick to the script unless things go sideways."
- **Key Phrases Practice:**
  - "Bonjour." (Hello)
  - "Je suis Américain(e)." (I am American)
  - "Pour le travail / Pour les vacances." (For work / For vacation) - *Player might choose based on cover.*
  - "Merci." (Thank you)
  - "Au revoir." (Goodbye)
- **Handler Voiceover (Internal Thought/Device):** "Just the basics. Don't draw attention."

### The Encounter

- Player approaches the customs officer. Exchanges basic greetings successfully.
- **Complication:** A second, stern-looking officer patrolling nearby overhears the American accent. He breaks off from his path and approaches the player purposefully.
- **Tension Build-up:** The officer begins speaking rapidly in French, perhaps asking more complex questions ("Purpose of your visit in detail?", "How long are you staying?", "Where is your accommodation?"). The player's device offers no immediate translation (or perhaps scrambled/partial translation due to stress/protocol). The handler is silent (adhering to protocol, cannot intervene). The player feels isolated and unprepared.
- **Resolution:** Just as the tension peaks, a commotion happens elsewhere in the terminal (a dropped suitcase, a minor argument, etc.). The stern officer is distracted, glances back at the player, gives a dismissive wave, and moves towards the disturbance. The initial customs officer stamps the passport and waves the player through.

### Post-Encounter Debrief (Exiting Airport/Heading to Taxi)

- **Handler (Voiceover/Meeting Agent):** "That was too close, rookie. See why sticking to the plan *and* being prepared matters? We can't afford unnecessary risks."
- **Handler:** "Your training isn't just about the device; it's about survival. Take it seriously. We can't lose another agent..."
- **Player (Internal Thought/Optional Dialogue Prompt):** "Another agent? What happened to..."
- **Handler (Cutting off):** "Shhh. Let's get that taxi. Eyes open."

### Mechanic Setup

This scene establishes the stakes and the importance of proactive language learning beyond just the UI elements. It reinforces the need to prepare for unexpected situations.

## V. First Mission: Café Lumière Rendezvous

### Café Objective

Meet the primary field contact.

### Café Setting

A designated café (`Café Lumière`).

### Café Language Focus

- **Greetings/Politeness:** "Bonjour", "Pardon", "Excusez-moi"
- **Verification Phrase:** Player must ask: "Est-ce que vous comprenez l'anglais?" (Do you understand English?). Handler responds: "Un peu." (A little.)
- **Simple Code Exchange:** Using basic numbers 1-5 (learned previously or prompted).

## VI. Second Mission: Neighborhood Reconnaissance

### Recon Objective

Gather environmental intelligence.

### Recon Setting

Streets around the café, featuring French signage.

### Recon Language Focus

- **Asking Directions:** "Où est...?" (Where is...?) to find key locations (e.g., post office, specific statue, metro station).
- **Managing Conversation Flow:** Using "Je comprends un peu le français." (I understand a little French) when NPCs respond too quickly or complexly.

### Task

Find and photograph three specific landmarks/locations using the learned phrases.

## VII. Asset Requirements

### Character Models

- Dark Mallard (Handler/Instructor) - with lip-sync capability.
- Field Handler Contact (Consider the fox character idea).
- Customs Officers (Standard + Stern).
- Generic NPCs (Café patrons, pedestrians).

### Environment Assets

- Airplane Interior (Briefing Scene).
- Device Interface (Dynamic, with replaceable text).
- Airport Customs Hall.
- Café Lumière Interior.
- Street Scene (with authentic French signage).

### Audio Elements

- Voice Acting (Dark Mallard, Handler, Officers, NPCs - varying levels of French/English).
- Ambient Sounds (Airplane cabin, bustling airport, café chatter, city street noise).
- UI Feedback Sounds (Spy-tech, subtle, satisfying clicks/beeps).
- Tense musical stinger for the airport officer encounter.
