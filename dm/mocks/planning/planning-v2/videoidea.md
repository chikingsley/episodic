# Video Idea

⸻

🔥 Do it. But do it modularly.

You’re already building a cinematic spy world. A dynamic intro video that serves as:
 • A theme tune (without the song),
 • An atmospheric setup, and
 • A story-first onboarding sequence

…is absolutely the right move for Dark Mallard.

⸻

🎬 Here’s the ideal breakdown:

First Launch Only
 • Full intro video:
 • Incoming transmission → you’ve been selected.
 • Visuals of the duck agency.
 • Glitches, dossiers, field ops, encrypted feeds.
 • Cuts between scenes and UI prompts.
 • Dialogue/video pauses → user inputs (e.g., “Accept Mission”, “Select Operation”).

You blend cinematic storytelling with real onboarding steps.

⸻

Subsequent Launches
 • A shortened cold-open version:
 • 3–5 sec intro sting (logo + encrypted duck eyes + glitch + “Welcome back, Agent”).
 • Then drop straight into Mission Control.

You let players skip, but the vibe remains embedded in the experience.

🧱 Implementation Strategy (MVP-Friendly)

You don’t need a full Pixar short out the gate. Do this:

 1. Intro Video = Stylized Slideshow + Audio + Text Animation
 • Just 3–5 animated scenes with VO or subtitles.
 • Minimal animation. Focus on music, glitch cuts, dramatic tone.
 2. Trigger Onboarding Flow from Inside the Video
 • Add input hotspots inside the video (or fake it by syncing animations + inputs).
 • Use your existing screens, just wrap them in that cinematic vibe.
 3. Reusability
 • Later on, reuse this video structure for new language arcs, holiday ops, or event briefings.

🧠 Why it Works

This ain’t just onboarding. It’s priming identity:
 • “You’re not a user. You’re an agent.”
 • The app becomes a role they return to, not just a product.

That’s the secret sauce of immersion.

🛠 Recommendation

Short-term:
 • ✅ Stick with your current flow for MVP
 • ✅ Build intro video as shell with 3–4 key transitions
 • ✅ Bake 1–2 interactive moments (even if it’s just accept mission + language select)

Post-launch:
 • 🎯 Expand that video engine into a narrative system
 • 🎯 Reuse for plot twists (e.g., you’re being reassigned, caught, etc.)
