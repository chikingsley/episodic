# Your First 625 (in Thematic Order, with notes)

## Key Concepts for Learning

* **Category Words**: (e.g., 'animal')
  * Learn these words by using 2-3 other pictures/words on your flashcards (e.g., 'animal = dog, cat, fish...').
  * Check the "Special Scenarios" section of the 2nd Gallery in the book, or watch the second half of the Kickstarter webinar recordings for examples.

* **Easily Confounded Images**: (e.g., 'girl' looks like 'daughter'*)
  * Designated with an asterisk (Like `this*`).
  * These are groups of words that will use very similar images (e.g., girl/daughter, marriage/wedding).
  * Learn these words by adding a personal touch (e.g., the name of a 'daughter' you might know) or an additional word or two in your target language (e.g., daughter might go with mother/father).
  * Again, see the "Special Scenarios" section of the 2nd Gallery for examples, or watch the Kickstarter webinar.

## Time & Direction

### Directions

top, bottom, side, front, back, outside, inside, up, down, left, right, straight, north, south, east, west, direction
> **Note:** You may not find all of these in your glossary, and you may have trouble finding pictures even if you do. That's fine. Skip them for now, or use the collection of images for directions and prepositions at [Fluent-Forever.com/Appendix5](https://fluent-forever.com/Appendix5).

### Seasons

Summer, Spring, Winter, Fall, season

### Numbers

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 30, 31, 32, 40, 41, 42, 50, 51, 52, 60, 61, 62, 70, 71, 72, 80, 81, 82, 90, 91, 92, 100, 101, 102, 110, 111, 1000, 1001, 10000, 100000, million, billion, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, number
> **Note:** If you search for a number (e.g., *uno* (one), *dos* (two), *tres* (three)), you'll find pictures of objects (1 apple, 2 monkeys, etc.). This usually works until 10. Then search for the digits (10, 11, 12). You'll find colorful numerals, address signs, etc. Use these images (e.g., picture of hotel room #33) instead of text (#33); these pictures are easier to remember and don't get mixed up as easily.

### Months

January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November, December
> **Note:** You'll usually find pictures of holidays and weather. Add in the number of each month (#1-12) to get more specific.

### Days of the week

Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
> **Note:** You'll usually find pictures of people going to work on Mondays and partying on Fridays/Saturdays, etc. To get more specific, use an image of a weekly calendar with weekends greyed out and indicate which day you want. An English-free one is available at [Fluent-Forever.com/Appendix5](https://fluent-forever.com/Appendix5).

### Time

year, month, week, day, hour, minute, second, morning, afternoon, evening, night, time
> **Note:** You'll find pictures of clocks and calendars. If needed, define each time division in terms of another (e.g., 60 x minuto = 1 \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (ora), 1 ora = 60 x \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (minuto)). Don't worry about plural forms yet.

## Word Types

### Verbs

work, play, walk, run, drive, fly, swim, go, stop, follow, think, speak/say, eat, drink, kill, die, smile, laugh, cry, buy*, pay*, sell*, shoot(a gun), learn, jump, smell, hear* (a sound), listen* (music), taste, touch, see (a bird), watch (TV), kiss, burn, melt, dig, explode, sit, stand, love, pass, by, cut, fight, lie down, dance, sleep, wake up, sing, count, marry, pray, win, lose, mix/stir, bend, wash, cook, open, close, write, call, turn, build, teach, grow, draw, feed, catch, throw, clean, find, fall, push, pull, carry, break, wear, hang, shake, sign, beat, lift
> **Note on Verbs:** You'll probably need to learn your language's word for "verb" and add it to any verb that could masquerade as a noun (e.g., "to kiss" vs. "a kiss"). Guidelines are provided in the "Special Scenarios" section of the book's Gallery, or in the discussion of flashcards at the end of the Kickstarter webinar recording.

### Adjectives

long, short (vs long), tall, short (vs tall), wide, narrow, big/large, small/little, slow, fast, hot, cold, warm, cool, new, old (new), young, old (young), good, bad, wet, dry, sick, healthy, loud, quiet, happy, sad, beautiful, ugly, deaf, blind, nice, mean, rich, poor, thick, thin, expensive, cheap, flat, curved, male, female, tight, loose, high, low, soft, hard, deep, shallow, clean, dirty, strong, weak, dead, alive, heavy, light (heavy), dark, light (dark), nuclear, famous
> **Note on Adjectives:** For a few of these, you may need to learn your language's word for "adjective" and add it in cases of ambiguity (e.g., "to clean" vs. "a clean room").

### Pronouns

I, you (singular), he, she, it, we, you (plural, as in "y'all"), they.
> **Important Note on Pronouns:**
>
> * Make sure you read about these in your grammar book before adding them. Languages divide their pronouns into many categories (e.g., Hungarian has six words for "you").
> * You'll want to find at least a few words to refer to yourself or someone else now to deal with grammar later.
> * You'll find a good explanation of pronouns (and a list) in the beginning of your grammar book. You do not yet need *him, her, his, their*, etc.; these will come later with grammar discussion.
> * **Learning without Translations:** Use pictures of people pointing at themselves/each other. A collection is available at [Fluent-Forever.com/Appendix5](https://fluent-forever.com/Appendix5) if Google Image searches don't yield good results.
> * If your language has different pronouns for different relationships (e.g., friends vs. acquaintances), take a few minutes to think of people you'd use these pronouns with and use their names on your flashcards.
