# Narrative Exploration v3 Development Plan

## Overview

Create a comprehensive narrative exploration document that integrates all systems-ready frameworks into a cohesive gameplay experience. This plan addresses pacing concerns, optimizes for 10-20 minute sessions, and refines the language learning methodology to focus on actual implementation rather than verbose theory.

## Key Integration Objectives

### 1. Mission Structure Refinement

Based on `mission_ex_v3.md` and `mission_ex_flow_v3.md` (60-70% there):

**What Works:**

- Handler Training Chamber concept
- Contextual Pimsleur drilling (8-10 minutes)
- Simulation before live mission
- Real-time handler support during missions
- Post-mission vocabulary integration

**What Needs Development:**

- Better flow between training and live mission
- More natural spaced repetition integration
- Clearer progression gates
- Session length optimization for 10-20 minute engagement

### 2. Systems Integration Requirements

**Core Systems to Integrate:**

- `design_philosophy_v7.md` - Story-first approach, pressure creates learning
- `system_dialogue_framework_v1.md` - Controlled open-ended dialogue
- `system_social_dynamic_framework_v2.md` - Three-target relationship management
- `system_spaced_repetition_v1.md` - Diegetic review mechanisms
