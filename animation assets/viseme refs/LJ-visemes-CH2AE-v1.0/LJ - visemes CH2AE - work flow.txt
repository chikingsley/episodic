LJ - visemes CH2AE

video tutorial:
https://vimeo.com/larsjandel/visemes-ch2ae


basic steps:

Character Animator:
- open Adobe Character Animator
- import the PSD-template "LJ visemes system v1.0.psd"
- add the file (now puppet) to a new scene
- make sure, it is set to 1920 x 1080 px and set your desired frame rate
- create visemes via live recording, keyboard triggers and/or imported audio
- when using an audio file: add it to the timeline, check if the duration of the scene and the "puppet" fits. Select the "puppet" and go to the menu bar: timeline/compute lip sync from scene audio

After Effects:
- import the Character Animator scene (works via dynamic link, or you could export an png-sequence with a wave file from CH and import it via the script), duration and fps should be fine
- import the AE-preset "LJ visemes CH2AE v1.0.aep"
- open the comp "LJ visemes v1.0" and copy it's three layers to the CH-comp
- make sure, the layer "visemes - CH2AE" is above the CH layer
- it should already work when you hit play
- expand or crop the layer "visemes - CH2AE" to the desired / comp length (the next step will ignore comp length as it seems...)
- expand the effect of the layer, select the expression driven component "viseme nr." and go to the menu bar animation/keyframe assistant/convert expression to keyframes
- select all generated keys and run the provided script "pt_RemoveDuplicateKeys.jsx"
- copy keys to "mouth shapes w/ CTRL"'s effect's "viseme nr." or your own layer, which is set up the same way
- done

Nope, it is not complicated at all, when you know the few steps!  ;)


Have fun!


Cheers, Lars.
