[0.00 --> 2.26]  This is Unit 1 of Pimsler's French One.
[2.90 --> 4.32]  Listen to this French conversation.
[5.22 --> 5.60]  Pardon.
[11.30 --> 29.06]  (speaking in French)
[17.12 --> 18.58]  "Women was ill."
[18.72 --> 22.76]  In the next few minutes, you'll learn not only to understand this conversation, but to
[22.90 --> 23.88]  take part in it yourself.
[24.90 --> 27.46]  Imagine an American man sitting next to a French woman.
[27.96 --> 31.46]  He wants to begin a conversation, so he says, "Excuse me."
[32.40 --> 37.92]  Pardon! The French speaker is going to repeat this word part by part, starting from the end.
[38.64 --> 43.74]  You're to repeat each part after him, trying to make your pronunciation sound exactly like his.
[44.38 --> 46.04]  Be sure you repeat aloud.
[47.24 --> 47.70]  Don't.
[49.68 --> 50.14]  Don't.
[52.12 --> 52.56]  Par.
[54.90 --> 55.40]  Par.
[57.48 --> 57.98]  Pardon.
[60.64 --> 61.02]  Pardon.
[63.60 --> 65.94]  How do you say "excuse me" in French?
[68.72 --> 69.08]  Pardon.
[71.90 --> 74.10]  Now he wants to ask her if she understands English.
[74.86 --> 78.42]  First the word "English", "listen" and "repeat".

[103.66 --> 105.52]  Now again with the L sound.
[108.36 --> 108.86]  L'anglais.
[114.58 --> 118.78]  The difference is that when the L sound is off, you're saying English, and when
[118.86 --> 120.96]  it's on, you're saying the English.
[121.88 --> 126.26]  Most of the time the L sound will be there in French, even when the word 'the' is not
[126.32 --> 127.28]  there in our language.
[127.80 --> 129.66]  once again say English

[152.98 --> 153.24]  Pardon.
[155.12 --> 156.32]  Say again, English.
[159.10 --> 159.66]  Languelet.
[159.66 --> 160.40]  [BLANKs.
[164.82 --> 168.10]  Now he wants to ask, "Do you understand?"
[168.28 --> 170.64]  Here's the word "understand".

[237.66 --> 239.42]  Do you remember how to say English?
[242.22 --> 242.78]  Long live!
[245.42 --> 246.86]  Say, you understand.
[247.10 --> 250.60]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[253.10 --> 257.06]  And now try to say understand English.
[260.60 --> 262.30]  You understand English.
[266.14 --> 267.42]  You understand English.
[267.70 --> 271.20]  [BLANK_AUDIO]

[274.38 --> 274.90]  Listen and repeat.
[276.16 --> 276.52]  Esque.
[279.10 --> 279.66]  Esque.
[282.20 --> 282.76]  Esque.
[285.44 --> 289.32]  Any statement can be made into a question just by putting this in front of it.
[290.12 --> 290.94]  Once again, say,
[298.48 --> 301.48]  And now try to ask, do you understand?
[304.34 --> 306.50]  Do you understand?
[309.42 --> 311.66]  Do you understand?

[327.32 --> 328.38]  is that you understand?
[332.36 --> 334.10]  ask me if I understand English
[349.22 --> 351.52]  the woman answers "No"
[352.14 --> 352.82]  "Listen and repeat"
[354.22 --> 354.44]  "No"
[354.44 --> 357.94]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[356.60 --> 356.82]  No.
[361.24 --> 363.14]  No, sir. Listen and repeat.
[364.18 --> 364.70]  No, sir.
[367.54 --> 368.00]  Siu.
[370.74 --> 371.28]  Siu.
[373.95 --> 374.28]  Me.
[378.64 --> 379.04]  Monsieur
[381.96 --> 382.44]  Monsieur
[384.60 --> 387.20]  How do you say sir or mister?
[389.74 --> 390.22]  Monsieur
[392.70 --> 393.90]  Say no sir
[396.58 --> 397.20]  No Monsieur
[399.80 --> 401.92]  How would you ask someone if he understands?
[414.42 --> 416.76]  Do you understand English?
[421.00 --> 422.34]  Is that you understand the English?
[426.72 --> 427.94]  Is that you understand the English?
[428.60 --> 438.60]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[432.30 --> 434.42]  The man says, "I understand."
[434.54 --> 436.14]  First the word "I" alone.
[436.76 --> 437.36]  Listen and repeat.
[439.16 --> 439.38]  "Je"
[447.48 --> 450.36]  And now the word "understand."
[451.58 --> 451.94]  Comprend.
[452.04 --> 454.24]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[454.54 --> 454.86]  learn

[475.76 --> 480.66]  I understand.
[483.62 --> 484.56]  I understand.
[487.45 --> 490.30]  Try to say "I understand English."
[490.30 --> 493.80]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[493.48 --> 506.90]  I understand the word "I understand" and you understand together.
[514.82 --> 517.20]  Say you understand.
[524.32 --> 526.52]  Say, I understand.
[529.72 --> 530.44]  I understand.
[533.44 --> 534.78]  Say, excuse me.
[540.10 --> 542.30]  Ask, "Do you understand?"

[631.10 --> 632.74]  Say, I don't understand.
[636.46 --> 637.38]  Je ne comprend pas.
[640.82 --> 643.52]  Notice that there are two things that make the sentence negative.
[644.12 --> 646.54]  Mainly it's the "pa" at the end.
[647.30 --> 651.82]  But also there's the end sound of "je n'listen again."
[652.38 --> 653.98]  "Je ne comprend pas."
[654.00 --> 658.26]  There are lots of little sounds like that that almost get thrown away in rapid speech.
[659.20 --> 663.32]  It's important to notice them, however, because they can often change the meaning of a sentence.
[664.22 --> 669.04]  Once again, say, "I don't understand."
[669.54 --> 670.48]  "Je ne comprend pas."

[804.90 --> 805.90]  I understand French.
[807.44 --> 811.08]  Listen again, noticing how the L sound gets tacked onto the word before.
[814.70 --> 818.22]  Now you try repeating it after the speaker part by part.

[871.96 --> 873.92]  I don't understand French.
[878.48 --> 880.42]  Say, you understand French.
[884.66 --> 885.68]  You understand French?
[894.02 --> 896.44]  Excuse me.
[898.92 --> 899.26]  Pardon.
[901.88 --> 903.42]  Ask me if I understand French.

[1538.46 --> 1540.08]  Now ask her if she understands English.
[1553.54 --> 1556.48]  How does she tell you that she doesn't understand English?
[1561.92 --> 1563.08]  I don't understand English.
[1566.98 --> 1569.20]  How does she ask you if you understand French?
[1574.82 --> 1576.06]  Do you understand French?

[1585.74 --> 1587.08]  I understand a little.
[1590.91 --> 1592.44]  How does she ask you if you're American?
