# Vocabulary Review Report - "Canne You Not" Series

## 1. Introduction

This report details the findings of a review conducted on the vocabulary plans for all 10 episodes of the "Canne You Not" series. The review focused on:
- Consistency of the planned spaced repetition schedule against the specified patterns.
- Identification of grammar topics introduced or implied by the vocabulary and communication goals.
- General accuracy check for spelling and rules.

## 2. Spaced Repetition Analysis

**Overall Finding:** **Resolved.** The implementation across the vocabulary files now consistently reflects the defined spaced repetition patterns. Files for Episodes 2 through 9 have been updated to match the patterns specified below.

**Episode-Specific Findings (Status as of 2025-04-13):**

*   **Ep 1 (`ep1-bienvenue-a-cannes-vocab.md`):** **OK.** Follows the `2,3,5,7,10` pattern.
*   **Ep 2 (`ep2-enchante-vocab.md`):** **Updated.** Now follows the pattern `Ep 3, 4, 6, 8`.
*   **Ep 3 (`ep3-je-tai-texte-vocab.md`):** **Updated.** Now follows the pattern `Ep 4, 5, 7, 9`.
*   **Ep 4 (`ep4-cest-qui-lui-vocab.md`):** **Updated.** Now follows the pattern `Ep 5, 6, 8, 10`.
*   **Ep 5 (`ep5-la-fete-vocab.md`):** **Updated.** Now follows the pattern `Ep 6, 7, 9`.
*   **Ep 6 (`ep6-la-police-vocab.md`):** **Updated.** Now follows the pattern `Ep 7, 8, 10`.
*   **Ep 7 (`ep7-premier-rendez-vous-vocab.md`):** **Updated.** Now follows the pattern `Ep 8, 9, 10`.
*   **Ep 8 (`ep8-tu-sors-avec-lui-vocab.md`):** **Updated.** Now follows the pattern `Ep 9, 10`.
*   **Ep 9 (`ep9-therapie-vocab.md`):** **Updated.** Now follows the pattern `Ep 10`.
*   **Ep 10 (`ep10-deuxieme-chance-vocab.md`):** **OK.** Primarily focuses on accumulated vocabulary reinforcement.

**Recommendation:** **Completed.** The "Spaced Repetition Plan" sections in files for Episodes 2-9 have been updated to strictly adhere to the desired patterns.

## 3. Grammar Topic Analysis

The vocabulary files list relevant "Grammar Focus" points for each episode, showing a good progression:

*   **Early Episodes (1-3):** Focus on basics - present tense (`être`, `parler`), introductions, tu/vous, basic questions, early Passé Composé, possessives, hints of future/conditional.
*   **Mid Episodes (4-6):** Expand on verb tenses (Passé Composé narration), reflexive verbs, negation, imperative, formal address.
*   **Later Episodes (7-10):** Introduce structures for compliments, opinions, abstract concepts, emotions, future/conditional, modal verbs.

**Potential Grammar Topics to Explicitly Cover/Refine:**

While the current focus is good, consider explicitly adding sections or reinforcing these areas in supplementary materials or within the episode "Freeze & Teach" moments:

1.  **Future Tenses:** Formal introduction of *Futur Simple* and *Futur Proche* (using `aller + infinitive`).
2.  **Conditional Tense:** Formal introduction of *Conditionnel Présent* for politeness, suggestions, hypothetical situations.
3.  **Imperfect Tense:** Introduce *Imparfait* for descriptions, background context, habitual actions in the past (contrasting with Passé Composé).
4.  **Object Pronouns:** Systematically introduce direct (le, la, les), indirect (lui, leur), and potentially `y` and `en`.
5.  **Adjective Agreement:** Consistently highlight masculine/feminine and singular/plural agreement rules.
6.  **Prepositions:** Explicitly teach common prepositions of place, time, and movement as they appear.
7.  **Passé Composé Refinement:** Ensure clear explanation of auxiliary verb choice (`être` vs `avoir`) and past participle agreement (especially with `être`).

## 4. Spelling and Accuracy

**Finding:** A review of the French vocabulary, translations, and notes did not reveal any major spelling errors or significant inaccuracies. The content appears linguistically sound for the target learning level.

## 5. Conclusion

The vocabulary plans provide a solid foundation for the series' language learning goals. The main area requiring attention is the **consistent implementation of the spaced repetition schedule** across all relevant files. Defining clear patterns for words introduced mid-series is crucial. Additionally, consider weaving in more explicit instruction on the suggested grammar points to enhance the learning structure.

**Recommended Next Steps:**
1.  Decide on the specific reinforcement patterns for words introduced in Episodes 4, 6, 7, 8, 9.
2.  Update the "Spaced Repetition Plan" tables in `ep2` through `ep9` vocabulary files to accurately reflect the chosen patterns.
3.  Consider how and where to best integrate the recommended additional grammar topics.
