# Simplified Drill Structure: Levels 2-5

## How the 8-Phase Drill Model Evolves After Level 1

The formalized 8-phase drill model in `src/drill_patterns.py` (LISTEN → BREAKDOWN → BACKCHAIN → COMBINE → EXPAND → DRILL → RECONSTRUCT → ROLEPLAY) accurately describes Level 1 lessons. But it does **not** describe Levels 2-5. The drill structure simplifies and transforms as the learner progresses.

---

## Level 1 Recap: The Full 8-Phase Model

```
LISTEN        → Hear target conversation (20-30s, played 2x)
BREAKDOWN     → Isolate individual words from conversation
BACKCHAIN     → Build pronunciation end-to-start (par-DON, com-pre-NEZ)
COMBINE       → Join words into phrases
EXPAND        → Add elements to phrases
DRILL         → Practice variations (person, tense, question forms)
RECONSTRUCT   → Build full sentences from components
ROLEPLAY      → Play a role in the target conversation
```

**Characteristics:**
- Heavy English narration (100% in L1-8)
- Extensive backchaining (7 instances in L1, declining to 0 by L8)
- Short, simple conversations (2-4 exchanges)
- Explicit breakdowns of every new word
- Reading introduced at L9, French instructions creep in L9-21
- Major flip at L22: French instructions jump to 80+

## Level 2: The Scaffold Model (4-Phase)

### What Changes

| L1 Phase | L2 Status | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| LISTEN | **KEPT** (enhanced) | Longer, more complex conversations |
| BREAKDOWN | **MERGED into drilling** | No longer a separate phase |
| BACKCHAIN | **RARE** | Only for genuinely difficult new words |
| COMBINE | **MERGED into drilling** | Happens within sentence drills |
| EXPAND | **MERGED into drilling** | Natural part of recombination |
| DRILL | **KEPT** (dominant) | The core of every lesson |
| RECONSTRUCT | **MERGED into drilling** | Not a distinct phase |
| ROLEPLAY | **KEPT** (enhanced) | Longer, more complex scenarios |

### The Level 2 Structure (4 Phases)

```
1. CONVERSATION    → Extended opening dialogue (30-60s, played 2x)
2. HIGHLIGHT       → Narrator isolates 1-2 key new phrases from dialogue
3. DRILL-CYCLE     → Interleaved recall/introduce/recombine/expand
4. SCENARIO        → Extended role-play integrating all material
```

### Evidence from Transcripts

**L2-U1 Opening:**
```
"This is unit 1 of Pimsleur's Speak and Read Essential French 2.
Écoutez cette conversation.
Mr. Jameson, an American, is speaking with Mrs. Berger..."
[Full conversation in French - 10 lines]
"Écoutez encore une fois cette conversation."
[Conversation replayed]
```

**Key differences from Level 1:**
- Conversation is immediately complex (passé composé, multiple tenses)
- Bilingual introduction: "Mr. Jameson, un Américain, parle avec Madame Berger"
- Conversation played twice (same as L1)
- No word-by-word breakdown of the conversation — goes straight to drills

**L2 Drill Cycle (typical sequence):**
```
"Now suppose you're speaking with a French acquaintance at her home."
"Ask her how she is."
[pause] → "Comment allez-vous?"               ← RECALL
"Dites, I am well, thank you."
[pause] → "Je vais bien, merci."               ← DRILL
"How does she ask, when did you arrive?"
[pause] → "Quand est-ce que vous êtes arrivé?"  ← RECALL
"Répondez. No, I arrived yesterday morning."
[pause] → "Non, je suis arrivé hier matin."     ← DRILL
"Comment dit-on? You like."
[pause] → "Vous aimez."                         ← NEW ITEM
```

**Backchaining in L2 (minimal):**
```
"Écoutez et répétez. You would like. Vous aimeriez."
"Riez."
"Riez."
"Aime."
"Aimeriez."
"Vous aimeriez."
```
This is still backward-buildup but it's used only for "aimeriez" — a genuinely new and complex word. Most L2 vocabulary is introduced without backchaining.

### L2 Instruction Language

Mixed English/French:
- English: "Now suppose you're speaking with..." / "Ask her how she is" / "Tell her that..."
- French: "Dites" / "Répondez" / "Essayez de dire" / "Comment dit-on" / "Elle demande"
- French instructions increase through the level, from ~30% to ~60% by L2-L30

### L2 Conversation Complexity

- Opening conversations use passé composé, multiple subjects, questions
- Role-play scenarios involve 8-12 exchanges (vs 3-5 in L1)
- Topics: past actions, future plans, opinions, making arrangements

---

## Level 3: The Immersion Model (3-Phase)

### What Changes from Level 2

| L2 Phase | L3 Status | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| CONVERSATION | **KEPT** (more complex) | Conversations about weather, travel, plans |
| HIGHLIGHT | **REDUCED** | Less English explanation of new phrases |
| DRILL-CYCLE | **KEPT** (faster pace) | More French instructions, less English |
| SCENARIO | **EXPANDED** | Multiple scenarios per lesson, longer exchanges |

### The Level 3 Structure (3 Phases)

```
1. CONVERSATION    → Opening exchange (may be omitted; sometimes starts with recall)
2. DRILL-CYCLE     → Fast-paced recall/new/recombine with French instructions
3. SCENARIO        → Multiple extended scenarios, increasingly naturalistic
```

### Evidence from Transcripts

**L3-U1 Opening:**
```
"This is unit one of Pimsleur's Speak and Read Essential French 3."
"Listen to this conversation which takes place at a dinner party in Nice."
[No conversation played — goes straight to recall/drill]
"Do you remember how to say, here is a photo?"
"Demandez-lui quand il est allé à New York."
```

**Key differences from Level 2:**
- Some lessons skip the opening conversation entirely
- Instructions are predominantly French: "Demandez-lui", "Comment dit-on", "Dites", "Il répond", "Comment votre ami dit-il"
- English is used mainly for setting scenarios and translating truly new words
- Backchaining is almost gone — appears only for compound phrases
- Scenarios flow more naturally with less explicit prompting

**L3 Drill Cycle (typical):**
```
"Demandez-lui quand il est allé à New York."
[pause] → "Quand est-ce que vous êtes allé à New York?"
"Il répond in January."
"Demandez-lui. How is the weather?"
[pause] → "Quel temps est-ce qu'il faisait?"
"Say, it was bad, referring to the weather."
[pause] → "Il faisait mauvais."
```

**New patterns in L3:**
- Imparfait used routinely (il faisait, il y avait)
- Weather vocabulary (chaud, froid, neige, pluie)
- Futur simple introduced (j'y vais → j'irai)
- Relative pronouns (qui, que)
- Subjunctive introduced through "il faut que"
- Self-introduction: "Permettez-moi de me présenter"

### L3 Instruction Language

~70% French instructions:
- "Demandez-lui" / "Comment dit-on" / "Dites" / "Essayez de demander"
- "Il répond" / "Elle demande" / "Comment votre ami dit-il"
- English used only for: new concept translation, scenario setup, cultural notes

## Level 4: The Advanced Drill Model (2-Phase)

### What Changes from Level 3

| L3 Phase | L4 Status | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| CONVERSATION | **KEPT** (complex) | Real-world scenarios (TGV, business, social) |
| DRILL-CYCLE | **DOMINANT** | Fast-paced, mostly French, complex grammar |
| SCENARIO | **MERGED with drills** | Drills happen within continuous scenarios |

### The Level 4 Structure (2 Phases)

```
1. CONVERSATION    → Complex opening dialogue (business, social, cultural)
2. DRILL-SCENARIO  → Continuous scenario-based drilling (drills = scenario)
```

### Evidence from Transcripts

**L4-U1 Opening:**
```
"This is unit one of Pimsleur's French Four."
"Leçon 1. Steve Green est dans le TGV."
"Le train à grande vitesse. Pour Lyon."
"Steve Green is on the TGV. The fast speed train to Lyon."
"Il parle avec une Française."
[Conversation with regional identity, opinions, business travel]
```

**Key differences from Level 3:**
- Narrative frame introduced: named character "Steve Green" with ongoing story
- Conversations are culturally rich (regional identity, food culture, business)
- Bilingual introduction: French lesson number + English context
- Grammar is complex from the start (venir de + inf, regional expressions)
- Drills and scenarios are indistinguishable — it's all one flowing conversation

**L4 Drill-Scenario (typical):**
```
"Now suppose you're the American Steve Green
 and you're on a plane to France."
"Demandez. Excuse me?"
[pause] → "Pardon?"
"Comment est-ce qu'elle demande si vous êtes Américain?"
[pause] → "Est-ce que vous êtes Américain?"
"Répondez-lui. Yes, I'm American."
[pause] → "Oui, je suis Américain."
"But my wife is French."
[pause] → "Mais ma femme est française."
```

**New patterns in L4:**
- Subjunctive after "il faut que" (28+ instances across level)
- Conditional perfect (j'aurais aimé, elle se serait habillée)
- Si + imparfait → conditional
- Named characters with ongoing narratives
- More nuanced social situations

### L4 Instruction Language

~80% French instructions by mid-level. English used primarily for:
- First translation of genuinely new vocabulary
- Complex scenario setup
- Grammar notes (very rare)

---

## Level 5: The Near-Native Model (1-Phase)

### What Changes from Level 4

| L4 Phase | L5 Status | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| CONVERSATION | **EXPANDED** | Long, naturalistic, multi-topic conversations |
| DRILL-SCENARIO | **KEPT** (naturalistic) | Feels like real conversation practice |

### The Level 5 Structure (1 Phase)

```
1. IMMERSIVE-PRACTICE → Conversation → scenario-drill → conversation (continuous)
```

By Level 5, the distinction between "drill" and "conversation" essentially disappears. The entire lesson is one flowing practice session with natural language.

### Evidence from Transcripts

**L5-U1 Opening:**
```
"This is Unit 1 of Pimsleur's French 5."
"After completing French levels 1 through 4,
 you are now familiar with the basic structures of the French language.
 Throughout French 5, you will practice and improve on what you've learned,
 while acquiring more complex vocabulary and structures.
 In order to do that well, you will need to rely more on your intuition,
 or your natural sense of the language,
 and less on literal cues and hints given in English."
[Long naturalistic conversation — wedding, moving, missing someone,
 philosophy about life — 15+ lines of natural French]
```

**Key differences from Level 4:**
- Explicit statement about relying on "intuition" and "natural sense"
- Opening conversations are long, natural, multi-topic (wedding, life philosophy)
- Conversations use complex grammar naturally (subjunctive: "il va falloir que j'aille")
- Cultural richness: idioms, colloquialisms, nuance
- Backchaining only for genuinely new compound words ("le décalage horaire")
- Scenario is realistic and detailed (hotel at 4am, jet lag, vending machine)

**L5 Drill Pattern (typical):**
```
"Maintenant, imaginez que vous êtes une Américaine dans un petit hôtel à Paris."
"Vous rencontrez un homme dans le couloir."
"Dites-lui. Excuse me, sir."
[pause] → "Excusez-moi, monsieur."
"Maybe you can assist me."
[pause] → "Peut-être que vous pouvez me renseigner."
"I really need a coffee."
[pause] → "J'ai besoin d'un café."
"But the kitchen is closed."
[pause] → "Mais la cuisine est fermée."
"Il dit... But ma'am, it's normal."
→ "Mais madame, c'est normal."
"It's four o'clock in the morning."
→ "Il est quatre heures du matin."
```

The drill IS the conversation. There's no separate phase — it's all integrated.

### L5 New Features
- ~28-30 new lexical/idiomatic items per lesson (higher than earlier levels)
- Complex tenses used naturally: conditional perfect, pluperfect, all subjunctive forms
- Advanced idioms: "c'est la vie, on n'y peut rien", "ça tombe bien", "mort de fatigue"
- Named character narratives continue across lessons

## What's Constant Across All Levels

Despite the simplification, some core elements remain across all 5 levels:

### 1. Opening Conversation (Always)
Every lesson at every level opens with a dialogue. The complexity grows:
- L1: 2-4 short exchanges, simple present
- L2: 8-10 exchanges, passé composé
- L3: Extended dialogue, multiple tenses
- L4: Complex scenario with cultural context
- L5: Long naturalistic conversation, all tenses

### 2. Prompt-Pause-Confirm Cycle (Always)
The core mechanic never changes:
1. English/French prompt → 2. Pause (2-4s) for learner → 3. Native speaker confirms

### 3. Spaced Repetition (Always)
Previous material is revisited at intervals. "Do you remember how to say...?" appears at every level.

### 4. Scenario-Based Practice (Always)
"Now suppose you're..." / "Maintenant, imaginez que..." — learner placed in realistic scenarios.

### 5. ~30-Minute Lesson Length (Always)
Every level maintains the same lesson duration.

### 6. ~9-10 New Items Per Lesson (Mostly)
Introduction rate stays remarkably consistent except at Level 5 (~28-30 items in final lessons).

---

## Implications for Course Generation

### For a Level 1 Generator:
- Use the full 8-phase model from `drill_patterns.py`
- Heavy backchaining for first 8 lessons, then taper
- 100% English instructions initially, introduce target language at L9
- Major instruction flip at L22
- Short conversations, explicit breakdowns

### For a Level 2 Generator:
- Use 4-phase scaffold model
- Assume all L1 vocabulary is known
- Backchaining only for genuinely new complex words
- Mix English/French instructions (~50/50)
- Longer conversations, passé composé focus
- Introduction of "on" for "we" and informal constructions

### For a Level 3 Generator:
- Use 3-phase immersion model
- French instructions dominant (~70%)
- Multiple scenarios per lesson
- Weather, travel, opinions, future plans
- Futur simple, subjunctive introduction
- Self-introduction patterns

### For a Level 4 Generator:
- Use 2-phase advanced model
- Named character with ongoing narrative
- French instructions ~80%
- Subjunctive mastery (28+ instances)
- Conditional perfect, complex si clauses
- Cultural/business scenarios

### For a Level 5 Generator:
- Use 1-phase immersive model
- Rely on "intuition" — minimal English
- Natural conversations with idioms
- All tenses/moods in play
- High new vocabulary rate (~28-30/lesson)
- Cultural nuance, colloquialisms

## Phase Mapping: What Each L1 Phase Becomes

| L1 Phase | L2 | L3 | L4 | L5 |
|----------|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| LISTEN | Conversation | Conversation | Conversation | Immersive |
| BREAKDOWN | Within drill | Rare | Gone | Gone |
| BACKCHAIN | Rare | Almost gone | Compounds only | Compounds only |
| COMBINE | Within drill | Within drill | Natural | Natural |
| EXPAND | Within drill | Within drill | Natural | Natural |
| DRILL | Drill-cycle | Drill-cycle | Drill-scenario | Immersive |
| RECONSTRUCT | Within drill | Within drill | Natural | Natural |
| ROLEPLAY | Scenario | Scenarios | Drill=Scenario | Everything |

The fundamental insight: **the 8 phases compress into a single continuous practice** as the learner progresses. What starts as distinct, labeled phases in Level 1 becomes an indistinguishable flow of natural conversation practice by Level 5.
