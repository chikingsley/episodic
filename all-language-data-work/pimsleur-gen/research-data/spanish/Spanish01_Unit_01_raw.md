[Speaker 1]
This is Unit 1 of Pimsleur's Speak and Read Essential Spanish 1.

[Speaker 1]
Listen to this Spanish conversation.

[Speaker 1]
In the next few minutes, you will learn not only to understand this conversation, but to take part in it yourself.

[Speaker 1]
Imagine an American man sitting next to a Spanish-speaking woman.

[Speaker 1]
He wants to begin a conversation, so he says,

[Speaker 1]
This, of course, is like the English word pardon,

[Speaker 1]
but the pronunciation is quite different.

[Speaker 1]
Your objective in this course is to pronounce everything

[Speaker 1]
just like the speakers with whom you will be conversing.

[Speaker 1]
Now the man is going to say this first word part by part.

[Speaker 1]
You are to repeat each part aloud after he says it.

[Speaker 1]
Did you repeat? Try it again.

[Speaker 1]
Continue repeating.

[Speaker 1]
How do you say, excuse me, in Spanish?

[Speaker 1]
Perdón

[Speaker 1]
Excuse me, miss. Listen and repeat.

[Speaker 1]
Perdón, señorita.

[Speaker 1]
Rita

[Speaker 1]
Rita

[Speaker 1]
Señorita

[Speaker 1]

[Speaker 1]

[Speaker 1]

[Speaker 1]
Again, say the word Miss.

[Speaker 1]

[Speaker 1]

[Speaker 1]
