[Speaker 1]
You have just had your first conversation in Spanish.

[Speaker 1]
From now on, most units, but not all, will contain some practice reading Spanish.

[Speaker 1]
We do not recommend doing the reading section while you are driving your car or where it is not convenient to work with the booklet.

[Speaker 1]
We do suggest, however, that you make the effort to do a reading unit daily, sometime after the appropriate lesson.

[Speaker 1]
If that is still inconvenient, you may undertake the readings after several units, say every five units,

[Speaker 1]
or you may do them all after you have completed the 30 lessons.

[Speaker 1]
The reading texts are recorded with their respective units and are also on the last CD.

[Speaker 1]
If you are doing the readings now, you will need your reading booklet.

[Speaker 1]
If you don't have the booklet at hand, stop now and start again when you're ready.

[Speaker 1]
Take your reading booklet and open it to the page containing the words for Unit 2.

[Speaker 1]
Look at the first word.

[Speaker 1]
Listen to the Spanish speaker pronounce it.

[Speaker 1]
Amigo.

[Speaker 1]
He'll read it again. You repeat after him.

[Speaker 1]
Amigo.

[Speaker 1]
Listen to word two and repeat it after him.

[Speaker 1]
Poco.

[Speaker 1]
There is a strong tendency when reading aloud to say the words with an American accent

[Speaker 1]
as if you were reading English instead of Spanish.

[Speaker 1]
You'll have to watch yourself constantly to avoid this.

[Speaker 1]
The Spanish speaker will read words 1 and 2 again now,

[Speaker 1]
and you repeat after him, trying to sound just like he did.

[Speaker 1]
Amigo.

[Speaker 1]
Poco.

[Speaker 1]
Now you try reading word 3.

[Speaker 1]
Camino.

[Speaker 1]
Read word three again.

[Speaker 1]
Watch the accent.

[Speaker 1]
Camino.

[Speaker 1]
Read word four.

[Speaker 1]
Pronto.

[Speaker 1]
Look at word five and listen.

[Speaker 1]
Llamo.

[Speaker 1]
The double L is pronounced ya.

[Speaker 1]
Listen and repeat word five.

[Speaker 1]
Llamo.

[Speaker 1]
Read word six.

[Speaker 1]
Llego.

[Speaker 1]
Seven.

[Speaker 1]
Semana.

[Speaker 1]
Eight.

[Speaker 1]

[Speaker 5] 9.

[Speaker 1]
Notice that the H is completely silent.

[Speaker 1]
You read the word just as if the H weren't there.

[Speaker 1]
Read word sixteen.

[Speaker 1]
Hasta

[Speaker 1] 17.

[Speaker 1] 18.

[Speaker 1]
Llama.

[Speaker 1]
Nineteen.

[Speaker 1]
Hablo castellano un poco.

[Speaker 1]
You have just read your first sentence in Spanish.

[Speaker 1]
This is the end of Unit 2.
