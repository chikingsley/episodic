[Speaker 1]
This is Unit 1 of Pimsleur's Russian One.

[Speaker 1]
Listen to this conversation.

[Speaker 1]
Извините, вы понимаете по-английски?

[Speaker 2]
Нет, я не понимаю по-английски.

[Speaker 1]
Я немного понимаю

[Speaker 3]
по-русски.

[Speaker 2]
Вы американец?

[Speaker 2]
Да,

[Speaker 1]
я американец.

[Speaker 1]
In the next few minutes, you'll learn not only to understand this conversation,

[Speaker 1]
but to take part in it yourself.

[Speaker 1]
Imagine an American man sitting next to a Russian woman on a bus in St. Petersburg.

[Speaker 1]
He wants to begin a conversation, so he says,

[Speaker 1]
Excuse me.

[Speaker 1]
Извините.

[Speaker 1]
The Russian speaker is going to repeat this word part by part,

[Speaker 1]
starting from the end.

[Speaker 1]
You are to repeat each part after him,

[Speaker 1]
trying to make your pronunciation sound exactly like his.

[Speaker 1]
Be sure you repeat aloud.

[Speaker 1]
Те.

[Speaker 3]
Ните.

[Speaker 3]
Ните.

[Speaker 3]
Вините.

[Speaker 3]
Из

[Speaker 3]
Извините

[Speaker 3]
Извините

[Speaker 1]
Say excuse me in Russian

[Speaker 3]
Извините

[Speaker 1]
Now he wants to ask her if she understands English.

[Speaker 1]
First the word English. Listen and repeat.

[Speaker 1]
По-английски

Ski

[Speaker 3]

[Speaker 3]

[Speaker 3]

[Speaker 3]

[Speaker 3]

[Speaker 1]
How do you say English?

[Speaker 1]
Pa-angliski

[Speaker 1]
Literally, this means in English.

[Speaker 1]
Say again English, meaning the English language.

[Speaker 3]
По-английски.

[Speaker 1]
Say, excuse me.

[Speaker 3]
Извините.

[Speaker 1]
Did you hear the «я» sound at the end of that word?

[Speaker 1]
You should repeat after the speaker gives the correct response,

[Speaker 1]
trying to make your pronunciation sound like his.

[Speaker 3]
Извините.

[Speaker 1]
Now he wants to ask,

[Speaker 1]
Do you understand?

[Speaker 1]
Here's the word understand.

[Speaker 1]
Понимаете?

[Speaker 1]
Repeat part by part.

[Speaker 1]
Те.

[Speaker 3]
Ете.

[Speaker 1]
Say understand.

[Speaker 1]
Here's how to say, you understand. Listen and repeat.

[Speaker 1]
The Russian word you ends with a sound which does not exist in English.

[Speaker 1]
Listen and repeat.

[Speaker 3]
Вы

[Speaker 1]
Вы

[Speaker 1]
Вы

[Speaker 3]
понимаете

[Speaker 1]
This is a common sound in Russian.

[Speaker 1]
Say again, you understand.

[Speaker 1]
Вы понимаете

[Speaker 1]
Remember how to say English.

[Speaker 1]
And now try to say, you understand English.

[Speaker 1]
Say again, you understand.

[Speaker 1]
Listen and repeat. Do you understand?

[Speaker 1]
To ask a question in Russian, you simply change the intonation of the statement.

[Speaker 1]
Say again, you understand.

[Speaker 1]
Now ask me if I understand.

[Speaker 1]
Say, excuse me.

[Speaker 1]
Извините.

[Speaker 1]
Вы понимаете?

[Speaker 1]
Try to ask me if I understand English.

[Speaker 3]
Вы понимаете по-английски?

[Speaker 1]
The Russian woman answers no. Listen and repeat.

[Speaker 4]
Нет.

[Speaker 4]
Нет.

[Speaker 4]
Нет.

[Speaker 1]
Say no.

[Speaker 4]
Нет.

[Speaker 1]
How would you ask someone if he understands?

[Speaker 2]
Вы понимаете?

[Speaker 2]
Вы понимаете?

[Speaker 1]
He says, I understand.

[Speaker 1]
First the word for I.

[Speaker 1]
Listen and repeat.

[Speaker 1]
Я.

[Speaker 1]
Я.

[Speaker 1]

[Speaker 1]
And now the word understand.

[Speaker 3]

[Speaker 3]

[Speaker 3]

[Speaker 1]
Say, I understand.

[Speaker 1]

[Speaker 1]
Try to say, I understand English.

[Speaker 3]
Я понимаю по-английски.

[Speaker 1]
Listen to I understand and you understand together.

[Speaker 1]
Я понимаю. Вы понимаете.

[Speaker 1]
Я понимаю.

[Speaker 1]
Вы понимаете.

[Speaker 1]
Say, you understand.

[Speaker 1]
Вы понимаете.

[Speaker 1]
Say, I understand.

[Speaker 1]
Я понимаю.

[Speaker 1]
Ask, do you understand?

[Speaker 1]
Ask the Russian woman if she understands English.

[Speaker 1]
How does she answer no?

[Speaker 4]
Нет.

[Speaker 4]
Нет.

[Speaker 1]
Now she wants to say, I don't understand. Listen and repeat.

[Speaker 1]
Say, I don't understand.

[Speaker 1]
It's the не which makes this sentence negative.

[Speaker 1]
This is the Russian word which means not.

[Speaker 1]
Listen again.

[Speaker 1]
There are lots of little sounds like that which almost get thrown away in rapid speech.

[Speaker 1]
It's important to notice them, however, because they can often change the meaning of a sentence.

[Speaker 1]
Once again, say, I don't understand.

[Speaker 1]
Say, English.

[Speaker 2]
По-английски.

[Speaker 1]
Say, I don't understand English.

[Speaker 2]
I don't understand English.

[Speaker 1]
Ask, do you understand?

[Speaker 1]
You

[Speaker 3]
understand?

[Speaker 1]
Ask me if I understand English.

[Speaker 3]
Вы понимаете по-английски?

[Speaker 1]
Answer, no, I don't understand.

[Speaker 2]
Нет, я не понимаю.

[Speaker 1]
I don't understand English.

[Speaker 2]
Я не понимаю по-английски.

[Speaker 1]
The name of the Russian language contains a rolling R sound.

[Speaker 1]
Listen and repeat.

[Speaker 1]

[Speaker 3]
Ски

[Speaker 3]

[Speaker 3]

[Speaker 1]
Ask her if she understands Russian.

[Speaker 3]
Вы понимаете по-русски?

[Speaker 1]
How would she say, I understand Russian?

[Speaker 2]
Я понимаю по-русски.

[Speaker 1]
Now ask her if she understands English.

[Speaker 3]
You understand English?

[Speaker 3]
She says

no.

[Speaker 4]
Нет.

[Speaker 4]
Нет.

[Speaker 1]
No, I don't understand.

[Speaker 2]
Нет, я не понимаю.

[Speaker 1]
I don't understand English.

[Speaker 2]

[Speaker 1]
How does she ask you if you understand Russian?

[Speaker 2]
Вы понимаете по-русски?

[Speaker 1]
Say, I understand Russian.

[Speaker 1]
Я понимаю

[Speaker 3]
по-русски.

[Speaker 1]
Here's how to say a little. Listen and repeat.

[Speaker 1]
You literally say, I a little understand. Try it.

[Speaker 1]

[Speaker 3]

[Speaker 1]
Say, I understand Russian.

[Speaker 1]
Я понимаю

[Speaker 3]
по-русски.

[Speaker 3]
Я понимаю по-русски.

[Speaker 1]
Say a little.

[Speaker 1]
Немного.

[Speaker 1]
Only a little. Listen and repeat. Only.

[Speaker 1]

[Speaker 3]

[Speaker 3]

[Speaker 1]
Now the Russian woman asks

[Speaker 1]
Are you American?

[Speaker 1]
Listen and repeat, an American

[Speaker 2]
Американец

[Speaker 2]
Нет

[Speaker 2]
Нет

[Speaker 2]
Америка

[Speaker 1]
The end of the word that means an American

[Speaker 1]
has a sound that's similar to the English word yet.

[Speaker 1]
Say American.

[Speaker 1]
To ask, are you an American in Russian,

[Speaker 1]
all you have to say is, you American, try it.

[Speaker 1]
Ask me if I am an American.

[Speaker 1]
Ask if I understand Russian.

[Speaker 2]
Вы понимаете по-русски?

[Speaker 1]
I understand a little Russian.

[Speaker 3]
I understand a little bit.

[Speaker 1]
What is the Russian word only?

[Speaker 1]
Только.

[Speaker 3]
Только.

[Speaker 3]
Only a little.

[Speaker 3]
Только немного.

[Speaker 3]
Только немного.

[Speaker 3]
Только

[Speaker 1]
немного.

[Speaker 1]
She asks again, are you an American?

[Speaker 1]
Here's how to say yes. Listen and repeat.

[Speaker 1]
Say yes.

[Speaker 1]
Try to say, yes, I am an American.

[Speaker 1]
Ask, are you an American?

[Speaker 2]
Вы американец?

[Speaker 1]

[Speaker 1]

[Speaker 3]
я американец.

[Speaker 1]
Say, excuse me.

I understand a little.

[Speaker 1]
Say only a little.

[Speaker 1]
Только немного.

[Speaker 1]

[Speaker 3]
немного.

[Speaker 1]
Now, sit back and listen to a Russian conversation, the same one you heard at the beginning of this tape only a few minutes ago.

[Speaker 1]
Извините, вы

[Speaker 3]
понимаете по-английски?

[Speaker 2]
Нет, я не понимаю по-английски.

[Speaker 3]
Я немного понимаю по-русски.

[Speaker 2]
Вы американец?

[Speaker 3]
Да, я американец.

[Speaker 1]
Now, imagine that you're the man sitting next to the Russian woman.

[Speaker 1]
You want to begin a conversation.

[Speaker 1]
What would you say to get her attention?

[Speaker 3]
Извините.

[Speaker 1]
Извините.

[Speaker 1]
She doesn't answer you.

[Speaker 1]
Ask her if she understands.

[Speaker 1]
Вы понимаете?

[Speaker 3]
Вы понимаете?

[Speaker 1]
Ask her if she understands Russian.

[Speaker 3]
Вы понимаете по-русски?

[Speaker 1]
She's still not answering.

[Speaker 1]
Now ask her if she understands English.

[Speaker 3]
Вы понимаете по-английски?

[Speaker 3]
You understand English?

[Speaker 2]
No.

[Speaker 2]
Нет.

[Speaker 1]
How does she tell you that she doesn't understand English?

[Speaker 2]
Я не понимаю по-английски.

[Speaker 2]
Я не понимаю по-английски.

[Speaker 1]
How does she ask you if you understand Russian?

[Speaker 2]
Вы понимаете по-русски?

[Speaker 2]
Вы понимаете по-русски?

[Speaker 3]
Я немного понимаю по-русски.

[Speaker 3]

[Speaker 1]
Say yes.

[Speaker 1]

[Speaker 1]
Да.

[Speaker 1]
Yes, I'm an American.

[Speaker 3]
Да, я американец.

[Speaker 3]
Да, я

[Speaker 1]
американец.

[Speaker 2]
Вы понимаете по-английски?

[Speaker 3]
Да, я понимаю по-английски.

[Speaker 1]
She's got another question.

[Speaker 1]
Answer it with the Russian expression, which means a little.

[Speaker 2]
Вы понимаете по-русски?

[Speaker 3]
Немного.

[Speaker 3]
Я немного понимаю по-русски.

[Speaker 1]
And that's true. Now you do understand Russian a little.

[Speaker 1]
Don't be concerned if you haven't made every response correctly.

[Speaker 1]
Everything you've just learned will be reviewed in future units.

[Speaker 1]
If you've mastered about 80% of the material in this lesson, you're ready to move on to the next.

[Speaker 1]
Otherwise, you should take another 30 minutes and try this lesson again.

[Speaker 1]
This is the end of today's lesson.

[Speaker 6]
When you continue with the next unit tomorrow, please begin with track number two.
