Je comprends un peu le français. 

00:02:09,839 --> 00:02:14,920 [Male Speaker]

- "suis" -

00:08:56,473 --> 00:09:04,253 [Narrator]

00:09:04,253 --> 00:09:05,113 [French Narrator]
- "Américain" -

00:09:05,113 --> 00:09:11,053 [Narrator]

Est-ce que vous êtes française? 

00:11:15,993 --> 00:11:22,594 [Male Speaker]
Est-ce que vous êtes française, mademoiselle? 

00:11:22,594 --> 00:11:28,333 [Narrator]
Now, you answer for her, "I am American." 

00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:32,733 [Female Speaker]
Je suis américaine. 

00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:38,820 [Narrator]
