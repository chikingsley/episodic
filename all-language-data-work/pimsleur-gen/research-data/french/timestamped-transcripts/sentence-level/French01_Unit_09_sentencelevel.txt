A une heure. 

00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:43,110 [Narrator]
The word -

00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:43,830 [French Narrator]
- "une" -

00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:46,550 [Narrator]
- is a feminine form showing that the word -

00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:47,209 [French Narrator]
- "heure" -

00:08:47,209 --> 00:09:00,649 [Narrator]
- is a feminine word. Only the number one has a masculine and feminine form. All the other numbers have only one form. Now say, "At one o'clock." 

00:09:00,649 --> 00:09:03,789 [Male Speaker]
A une heure. 

00:09:03,789 --> 00:09:05,190 [Narrator]
Notice that the word -

00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:05,849 [French Narrator]
- "heure" - 

00:09:05,849 --> 00:09:19,169 [Narrator]
- begins with a vowel sound. Therefore, any word that comes before it is likely to be changed in some way. Listen for this change as you learn to say, "Nine o'clock." Listen and repeat. 

00:09:19,169 --> 00:09:23,529 [Male Speaker]

00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:27,149 [Male Speaker]

00:10:45,409 --> 00:10:50,089 [Narrator]
Ask, "At eight o'clock?" 

00:10:50,089 --> 00:10:53,409 [Male Speaker]
