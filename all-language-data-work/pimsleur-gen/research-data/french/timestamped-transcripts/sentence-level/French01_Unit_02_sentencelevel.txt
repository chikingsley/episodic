Comment.

For, "How are you?" The French say, "How do you go?" So here is how to say, "You go." Listen and repeat.

00:12:02,834 --> 00:12:06,233 [Male Speaker]
Vous allez.

Vous allez. 

00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:23,271 [Narrator]
In order to make this into a question, we could use the -

00:12:23,271 --> 00:12:24,132 [French Narrator]
- "est-ce que" -

00:12:24,132 --> 00:12:29,151 [Narrator]
- form. But in this case, another way is more common. Instead of saying -

00:12:29,151 --> 00:12:30,311 [French Narrator]
- "vous allez" -

00:12:30,311 --> 00:12:32,192 [Narrator]
just turn it around and say -

00:12:32,192 --> 00:12:32,952 [French Narrator]
- "allez-vous."

00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:39,791 [Narrator]
This makes it a question. Now listen and repeat as the speaker asks, "How are you?"

00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:43,751 [Male Speaker]
Comment allez-vous?

00:12:43,751 --> 00:12:47,731 [Male Speaker]
Comment allez-vous?

00:12:47,731 --> 00:12:50,071 [Narrator]
Did you notice the "T" sound at the end of -

00:12:50,071 --> 00:12:50,532 [French Narrator]
- "comment."

00:12:50,532 --> 00:12:52,551 [Narrator]
Listen again.

00:12:52,551 --> 00:12:54,631 [Male Speaker]
Comment allez-vous?

00:12:54,631 --> 00:12:55,852 [Narrator]
This shows that the word -

00:12:55,852 --> 00:12:56,571 [French Narrator]
