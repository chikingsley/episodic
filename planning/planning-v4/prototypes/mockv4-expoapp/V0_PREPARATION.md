# v0 Preparation Strategy

## Current State Analysis

### ‚úÖ Strengths of mockv4-expoapp

- Well-structured Expo Router navigation
- Comprehensive component library
- Strong TypeScript foundation
- Convex backend integration
- Tailwind CSS styling system
- Content organization structure

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Areas Needing Organization

#### 1. Component Architecture

**Current Issue:** Mixed component patterns and naming conventions
**Action Required:**

- Standardize component exports (default vs named)
- Unify prop interface naming
- Consolidate similar components
- Remove unused components

#### 2. Content Structure

**Current Issue:** Content scattered across multiple directories
**Action Required:**

- Define clear content schema
- Organize lesson progression
- Establish narrative integration points
- Create content validation system

#### 3. Navigation Flow

**Current Issue:** Unclear app flow and state management
**Action Required:**

- Map complete user journey
- Define navigation hierarchy
- Plan authentication states
- Design offline scenarios

## v0 Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation Cleanup (Week 1-2)

1. **Component Audit**

   ```text
   components/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ui/ (keep shadcn/ui components)
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ core/ (rename from common/, essential app components)
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ learning/ (lesson-specific components)
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ narrative/ (story/character components)
   ```

2. **Remove Experimental Code**
   - Clean up showcase components
   - Remove development testing files
   - Simplify complex animations for now

3. **Standardize Imports**
   - Create barrel exports
   - Establish import conventions
   - Set up path aliases

### Phase 2: Core Features (Week 3-4)

1. **Learning Engine**
   - Basic spaced repetition
   - Progress tracking
   - Simple lesson structure

2. **Character System**
   - Dark Mallard introduction
   - Basic narrative progression
   - Character state management

3. **Authentication**
   - User registration/login
   - Progress persistence
   - Offline data sync

### Phase 3: Polish & Testing (Week 5-6)

1. **User Experience**
   - Onboarding flow
   - Accessibility improvements
   - Performance optimization

2. **Content Integration**
   - First lesson series
   - Basic narrative integration
   - Audio system setup

## Immediate Action Items

### üî• High Priority

1. **Create Component Inventory**
   - [ ] List all components and their usage
   - [ ] Identify duplicates and overlaps
   - [ ] Plan consolidation strategy

2. **Define App Architecture**
   - [ ] State management strategy (Zustand vs Context)
   - [ ] Data flow patterns
   - [ ] Error handling approach

3. **Content Schema Design**
   - [ ] Lesson data structure
   - [ ] Progress tracking format
   - [ ] Narrative integration points

### üìã Medium Priority

1. **Development Environment**
   - [ ] Set up proper development scripts
   - [ ] Configure testing framework
   - [ ] Establish build pipeline

2. **Documentation**
   - [ ] Component documentation
   - [ ] API documentation
   - [ ] Development guidelines

### üìù Low Priority

1. **Performance**
   - [ ] Bundle size optimization
   - [ ] Image optimization
   - [ ] Lazy loading strategy

## Key Decisions for v0

### Technology Choices

- **State Management:** Keep simple with React state + Context for now
- **Navigation:** Expo Router (already established)
- **Backend:** Convex (already integrated)
- **Styling:** Tailwind + NativeWind (working well)

### Feature Scope

- **MVP Features Only:** Login, basic lessons, progress tracking
- **Defer:** Advanced animations, complex narrative branches
- **Focus:** Core learning loop that works reliably

### Code Organization

- **Monorepo Structure:** Keep single app structure for now
- **Component Library:** Build internal component system
- **Content Management:** Simple file-based content initially

## Success Metrics for v0

1. **Functionality**
   - [ ] User can complete onboarding
   - [ ] User can complete basic lesson
   - [ ] Progress is saved and restored
   - [ ] App works offline (basic functionality)

2. **Code Quality**
   - [ ] TypeScript strict mode with no errors
   - [ ] Consistent component patterns
   - [ ] Clean, readable code structure
   - [ ] Proper error handling

3. **User Experience**
   - [ ] Smooth navigation
   - [ ] Responsive design
   - [ ] Dark Mallard character feels engaging
   - [ ] Learning feels rewarding

## Next Steps

1. **Start with Component Audit** - Create inventory of all components
2. **Plan Architecture** - Design state management and data flow
3. **Clean and Organize** - Remove unused code and standardize patterns
4. **Build Core Loop** - Focus on essential learning functionality
5. **Test and Iterate** - Ensure stability before adding features
