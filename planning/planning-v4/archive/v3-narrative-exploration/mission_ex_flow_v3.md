# Act 1: Missions 1-3 Integration

## Mission 1: Charles de Gaulle Airport - First Contact

### Briefing Phase

**Operational Goal:** Establish cover identity and test field readiness. Make contact with airport informant "Marcel" - baggage handler who's been feeding intel about suspicious passenger manifests.

**Handler Training Chamber - "Immigration Prep"**
*Sheldon:* "Immigration interviews can blow your cover in 30 seconds. We're drilling essential identity establishment."

**Contextual Drilling (8 minutes):**

- Basic identity phrases: "Je suis touriste," "Vacances," "Trois jours"
- Confidence responses: "Bien sûr," "Naturellement"
- Deflection techniques: "Un peu fatigué," "Long vol"

**Field Intelligence Preview:** "Listen to these intercepted conversations from CDG security..."
*[Audio of French conversations with travel context - passive exposure]*

**Simulation Chamber:** Practice with AI immigration officer

**Vocabulary Confidence at Mission Start:** 70%

### Live Mission

**Marcel Contact:** Simple baggage claim interaction to establish ongoing relationship
**Immigration Challenge:** Real-time conversation with actual consequences
**Unknown Word Encounter:** "Séjour" (stay/visit) - player must interpret from context or call handler (costs 1 Cover Point)

### Mission Outcome

**Intelligence Gained:** Marcel willing to provide passenger manifests
**New Vocabulary:** 3 travel-related terms noted for next training session
**Cover Status:** Established as American tourist
**Meta Story Hook:** Marcel mentions "unusual passenger patterns" - sets up Mission 2

## Mission 2: Latin Quarter Café - Asset Development

### Briefing Phase

**Operational Goal:** Develop Madame Dubois as neighborhood intelligence asset. Marcel's passenger data shows increased private jet traffic from Eastern Europe - need ground-level intel on who's buying local properties.

**Handler Training Chamber - "Café Social Dynamics"**
*Pane:* "Café owners see everything. Drilling customer interaction and neighborhood intelligence gathering."

**Field Intelligence Preview:** "Agents are reporting increased tension in traditional neighborhoods..."
*[Player listens to agent conversations, picks up vocabulary contextually]*

**Training Progression:**

- Airport vocabulary (from Mission 1) reinforced through "travel story" conversation
- New café and neighborhood terminology introduced
- Cultural sensitivity protocols

### Spaced Repetition Integration

**Agent Support Call:** "Control, I'm at Orly and the baggage handler is asking about my 'séjour' - what should I say?"
*[Player uses Mission 1 vocabulary to help, reinforcing their learning]*

### Live Mission

[As detailed before, but with Marcel's intel creating urgency]

### Mission Outcome

**Meta Story Development:** Madame Dubois confirms "too many foreigners buying buildings" - connects to Marcel's passenger data
**Vocabulary Bank:** Now includes travel + café domains
**Relationship Network:** Marcel (airport) + Madame Dubois (neighborhood) established

## Mission 3: Art Gallery Opening - High Society Infiltration

### Briefing Phase

**Operational Goal:** Infiltrate gallery opening to identify the Eastern European buyers Marcel and Madame Dubois referenced. Gallery owner "Philippe" is suspected money laundering front.

**Handler Training Chamber - "High Society Protocols"**
*Sheldon:* "Art world has its own language and social codes. One mistake marks you as nouveau riche American tourist."

**Training Evolution:**

- Previous café vocabulary tested in upscale context ("un café" becomes "un espresso")
- Art and cultural terminology introduced
- Formal register and cultural knowledge required

### Dynamic Field Intelligence

**Live Agent Feed:** "We have three agents at similar events across Paris. Listen and identify suspicious conversations..."
*[Player monitors multiple audio streams, applying accumulated vocabulary]*

### Unknown Vocabulary Challenge

**New Encounter:** Gallery patrons discussing "acquisitions" and "patrimoine"
**Handler Decision:** Call for immediate translation (costs Cover + time) or interpret from context and note for later

### Live Mission

**Complex Social Navigation:** Must use vocabulary from all previous missions

- Airport travel story (establishing background)
- Café cultural knowledge (building rapport)
- New art terminology (fitting in)

**Information Gathering:** Identify which gallery patrons match Marcel's passenger manifests

### Mission Outcome

**Major Intel:** Confirmed connection between airport arrivals and property purchases
**Vocabulary Mastery:** Three domains now accessible (travel, social, cultural)
**Meta Story Progression:** Conspiracy becomes clear - need deeper infiltration
**Network Effect:** Previous assets (Marcel, Madame Dubois) provide supporting intelligence

## Core Loop Integration

**Session Structure:**

1. **Mission Briefing** (2 min) - Goals and context
2. **Handler Training** (8-10 min) - Contextual Pimsleur drilling
3. **Field Intelligence** (3 min) - Passive exposure + agent support
4. **Live Mission** (15-20 min) - Real interaction with consequences
5. **Debrief & Notation** (2 min) - Unknown words marked for next session

**Spaced Repetition Flow:**

- Mission 1 vocabulary reinforced in Mission 2 training
- Mission 2 vocabulary reinforced in Mission 3 training  
- Agent support calls use previous mission contexts
- Real mission requires integration of all learned domains

**Meta Story Progression:**

- Airport → Neighborhood → High Society reveals escalating conspiracy
- Each asset provides intelligence that enables next level access
- Player's growing vocabulary directly enables deeper infiltration

**Unknown Word Mechanics:**

- Note for later training (free, recommended)
- Context interpretation (builds skill, sometimes works)
- Handler consultation (costs Cover Points, always accurate)

This structure keeps the language learning disguised as spy training while building genuine progression in both story complexity and linguistic competency.
