# Mission 2: Café Asset Building - Revised with Handler Training

## Phase 1: Handler Training Chamber

**Sheldon's Briefing:** "Alright agent, café infiltration is an art form. You're going to practice with our Madame Dubois simulation until you can handle basic rapport building and information extraction. This isn't a language lesson—this is survival training."

### Contextual Pimsleur Drilling (10 minutes)

**Handler:** "Listen and repeat. You walk into the café. Say: 'Bonjour madame.'"
**Player:** [Speaks] "Bonjour madame."
**Handler:** "Good. She responds: 'Bonjour monsieur.' Now order coffee: 'Un café, s'il vous plaît.'"
**Player:** [Speaks] "Un café, s'il vous plaît."

*[Visual: Animated café scene with simulated Madame Dubois]*

**Handler:** "She's testing if you're tourist or regular. She says: 'Vous n'êtes pas d'ici?' You need to sound natural. Say: 'Non, je suis américain.'"

*[Continue for 8-10 key phrases, building to actual conversation patterns]*

**Training Result:** Vocabulary confidence starts at 65% instead of 30%

## Phase 2: Mission Simulation Room

**Sheldon:** "Now we test under pressure. This is full simulation—if you blow it here, you're not ready for the real thing."

*[Player enters full café simulation with AI Madame Dubois]*

**Simulated Dubois:** "Bonjour, monsieur. Qu'est-ce que vous voulez?"

**Player Options:**

1. Use trained phrase: "Un café, s'il vous plaît, madame" (85% confidence)
2. Wing it: [Open response] (Current vocabulary confidence applies)
3. Handler backup: [Sheldon provides real-time coaching]

*[If simulation succeeds, unlock real mission. If not, additional drilling recommended]*

## Phase 3: Live Mission

**Handler Check:** "Simulation complete. Vocabulary confidence: 78%. Ready for live operation?"

*[Real mission proceeds as before, but player has actually learned the vocabulary through spy-themed drilling rather than academic lessons]*

### Real-Time Handler Support

**During mission, if player encounters unknown vocabulary:**

**Unknown word detected: "communauté"**
**Sheldon:** "Community—she's talking about neighborhood community. Store that for later drilling."

*[Word automatically added to next training session]*

## Phase 4: Post-Mission Training Update

**Sheldon:** "You picked up three new terms in the field. Let's drill them so you're ready for advanced café operations."

*[Brief contextualized drilling of "communauté," "vraie," etc. using café scenario]*
