## Story Structure Analysis

**What Works:**

- **Escalating Stakes:** From murder → network → bombs → conspiracy → ideology war
- **Moral Complexity:** No clear good/evil, everyone has believable motivations  
- **Player Agency:** Your choices genuinely affect story outcomes and character development
- **Thematic Coherence:** Every episode reinforces core questions about justice, power, and corruption

**The Central Story Engine:**
The game works because it's ultimately about **you** - how fighting extremism changes the fighter. Every interrogation is both a puzzle to solve and a mirror reflecting your moral choices back at you. The Liberation Front isn't just the enemy - they're a test of who you become under pressure.

**The Narrative Hook:**
"To defeat the monster, how much of a monster must you become?" This drives every conversation, every choice, every interrogation technique. The story succeeds because the real stakes aren't just stopping terrorism - they're about whether you can stop it while remaining human.
