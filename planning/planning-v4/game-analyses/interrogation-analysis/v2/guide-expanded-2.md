## Game Overview

"Interrogation: You will be deceived" is a narrative puzzle game in a noir detective setting developed by Critique Gaming and published by Mixtvision. Released on December 5, 2019, this 5-6 hour psychological thriller puts you in the role of an unnamed detective leading a special task force to dismantle a dangerous terrorist organization known as The Liberation Front.

### Key Features

- Complex conversational puzzles with psychological manipulation mechanics
- Team and resource management between interrogations
- Multiple branching storylines with five distinct endings
- Deep exploration of moral and ethical dilemmas
- Symbolic (non-graphic) depictions of performing torture

The game has been compared to titles like "Papers, Please," "This War of Mine," and "Orwell" for its attempts to raise important moral, ideological and practical questions about contemporary issues including terrorism, police brutality, and power imbalances.

## Foreword

**WARNING: THIS GUIDE CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS**

This comprehensive guide is designed to help achievement hunters obtain all achievements in "Interrogation: You Will Be Deceived." I strongly recommend playing through the game at least once blind before using this guide, as knowing the outcomes and strategies will significantly impact your first-time experience.

**Important Note**: This game deals with mature themes including radical ideologies, human casualties resulting from terrorism and contains symbolic (non-graphic) depictions of performing torture. The narrative challenges players to confront difficult moral choices about the means used to achieve justice.

## Core Game Mechanics

### Interrogation System

The heart of the game revolves around psychological interrogations where you must extract information from suspects through various methods:

#### Psychological Meters

- **Heart Rate (Fear)**: Indicates how afraid or stressed the suspect is. A higher heart rate means more fear.
- **Pupil Dilation (Openness)**: Shows how receptive or trusting they are toward you. A wider pupil means more openness.

These meters are crucial for determining your approach. A frightened subject may be more responsive to threats, while an open one could be convinced with sympathy.

**Example in Action:** In the tutorial with Douglas Byrd, you can see this in action. Initially, asking direct questions like "Why do you steal bikes?" fails. But shifting to an empathetic approach ("Can't believe they have me chasing bikes") makes his pupil meter dilate, showing he's more open to talk. Later, threatening him with prison time ("You know how many months you do for a bike theft?") makes his heart rate spike, indicating fear.

#### Interrogation Techniques

1. **Empathy**: Building rapport and trust with suspects.
2. **Intimidation**: Using fear and pressure to break down resistance.
3. **Manipulation**: Exploiting psychological vulnerabilities, often by using information from their file or other suspects.
4. **Enhanced Interrogation**: Turning off the recorder to use physical methods.

### Enhanced Interrogation (Torture) Mechanics

At any point in the interrogation, you can turn off the recorder and select a variety of torture options. These include:

- Getting in the suspect's face
- Slamming them against walls
- Using implements like knives or tasers
- More extreme methods unlocked through certain "memories" (traits)

**Important**: You can even overdo it, incapacitating them. In mechanical terms, it usually causes fear levels to skyrocket. However, using these methods has severe consequences:

- Damages your public reputation
- Affects team morale
- Can lead to false confessions from innocent suspects
- Impacts which endings become available
- May result in your character developing mental instability

**Example of Consequences:** The playthrough demonstrates that while using the taser on Byrd makes him "terrified" and leads to a quick confession, the instructor immediately warns you about the consequences. This establishes early on that these methods, while effective for raising fear, come at a cost to your professional standing and reputation.

### Team Management System

Between interrogations, you manage a team of three core investigators, each with their own skills and moral boundaries:

#### Team Mechanics

- **Motivation Levels**: Each team member has individual morale that affects mission success rates.
- **Mission Assignments**: Send team members to gather intelligence, work with informants, or handle public relations.
- **Budget Allocation**: Limited resources must be divided between:
  - Team development and morale
  - Information gathering missions
  - Public relations efforts
  - Emergency responses

#### Key Team Interactions

The game includes narrative scenes that develop your team's characters and affect morale.

**Example 1: Clearing the Air:** In Chapter 5, Jennifer approaches you to "clear the water" about the leadership role. Your response—such as "I'm glad to hear it. Let's do good work"—directly impacts your relationship with her and sets a collaborative tone for the team.

**Example 2: Team Building:** After the mall bombing, Jennifer offers to go for drinks at "Hannigan's." Choosing to go leads to a team-building scene where you play 'Marry, Kiss, Kill' with historical figures. This scene has no immediate gameplay benefit but serves to boost morale and flesh out the personalities of your team.

### Reputation System

Your actions affect three key reputation metrics:

1. **Public Opinion**: How citizens view your department. Affected by use of force, press statements, and preventing attacks. High reputation brings support; low reputation risks protests or assassination.
2. **Press Relations**: Media coverage of your activities. Affected by transparency, press conferences, and leaks. High reputation leads to favorable coverage; low reputation brings scrutiny.
3. **Authority Approval**: Support from police hierarchy and government. Affected by case success rate, following protocol, and political alignment. High reputation brings resources; low reputation leads to budget cuts or being fired.

### Memory System (Character Traits)

Throughout the game, you'll choose "memories" that define your detective's background and approach, unlocking unique dialogue and actions.

#### Examples of Memories

- **Pacifist**: Cannot use enhanced interrogation but gains empathy bonuses.
- **Scholar of Ideology**: Unlocks dialogue options about political theory. The playthrough shows this being chosen after the Horn Bunny 49 case, anticipating future ideological battles.
- **Profiler**: Provides numerical precision for psychological meters.
- **Mad Genius**: Associated with mental instability and extreme methods.
- **Messiah Complex**: Believes in extrajudicial justice.
- **Double Agent**: Allows unique infiltration dialogue options.

## The Liberation Front - Understanding the Factions

The Liberation Front is an implausibly slippery alliance of left, right, and libertarian partisans all at once, united in their opposition to the current system but divided in their vision for the future. Understanding these ideological divisions is crucial for successful interrogations and achieving specific endings.

### The Three Leaders (The Triumvirate)

#### 1. Anaba Lee - The Collectivist Wing

- **Ideology**: Socialist/communist ideals focused on equality and collective ownership.
- **Followers**: Activists, social justice advocates, community organizers.
- **Key Beliefs**: Wealth redistribution, dismantling class structures, collective decision-making.
- **Interrogation Approach**: Responds to discussions about inequality, social justice, and community.
- **Associated Ending**: "No Kings, No Destinies"

#### 2. Damascus Reed - The Individualist Wing

- **Ideology**: Libertarian/anarcho-capitalist focused on personal freedom and minimal government.
- **Followers**: Entrepreneurs, tech libertarians, free-market advocates.
- **Key Beliefs**: Stateless society, private property rights, individual sovereignty.
- **Interrogation Approach**: Responds to discussions about freedom, markets, and individual rights.
- **Associated Ending**: "Never Tread On Me"

#### 3. Colonel James Bennett - The Authoritarian Wing

- **Ideology**: Right-wing authoritarianism focused on order and traditional hierarchy.
- **Followers**: Military personnel, traditionalists, those seeking strong leadership.
- **Key Beliefs**: Social cleansing, restoration of order, elimination of perceived degeneracy.
- **Interrogation Approach**: Responds to discussions about strength, order, and tradition.
- **Associated Ending**: "Evolve Or Die"

### Faction Dynamics

- Bennett and Lee are ideological opposites and despise each other.
- Reed occupies a middle ground but has personal connections with both.
- Damascus had "amazing sex in Saigon" with Anaba - a detail that can be exploited.
- Each leader can be manipulated to betray the others by exploiting ideological differences.

## Story Achievements

These achievements require completing each episode on **Challenge Mode**. This mode features stricter time limits, more resistant suspects, and less margin for error. **Note**: These are the ONLY achievements that require Challenge Mode.

### Tutorial & Episode Achievements

#### Taking Names and Asking Questions

- **Requirement**: Complete the police academy lesson.
- **Details**: This tutorial teaches basic interrogation mechanics. Cannot be missed.

#### Episode-Specific Achievements

1. **It's Always The Husband** - Complete Episode 1
    - **Strategy:** First, exhaust dialogue with the burglar, Jerry Cox, establishing he has no history of violence. Then, with the husband, Darrell Peterson, build empathy by agreeing with his 'tough guy' worldview. This leads him to reveal key information: his resentment for his wife ("she could be such a shrew"), his ownership of a gun, and his connection to the "Liberation Front."

2. **The Hornbunny Identity** - Complete Episode 2
    - **Strategy:** This is a timed interrogation. Cross-reference the nickname "Cat Lover 5" given by Fred Ennis with the other suspects. When they deny his existence, confront Fred. Use threats ("The last Liberation Front sympathizer... left with broken legs") to raise his fear and secure the password "Excelsior."

3. **Let's Go To The Mall. Today.** - Complete Episode 3
    - **Strategy:** Identify the security guard, Daniel Wilson, as the likely bomber. Build empathy by sympathizing with his military background ("Good work, soldier") and his financial struggles with his mother's medical bills. The critical dialogue path involves promising that his mother will be cared for, leading him to confess he was blackmailed.

4. **On the Subject of Delusions** - Complete Episode 4
    - **Strategy:** The key is manipulating the mentally unstable Alex Novak. Feed his paranoia by agreeing with his conspiracy theories ("the nanobots have reached your brain"). This breaks him, causing him to repeat phrases he was told, including the order to buy "nitromethane" from "Father Gabriel." Use this information to confront and break the priest, Gabriel Adams.

5. **The Veterinary Quandary** - Complete Episode 5
    - A hostage situation requiring negotiation and emotional manipulation.

6. **Broken People** - Complete Episode 6
    - Deep dive into Liberation Front recruitment and radicalization.

7. **Disarming Choices** - Complete Episode 7
    - **Strategy:** Discover that the factory owner, King, has a secret backdoor and his business is fully insured. After building empathy by aligning with his capitalist views, deceive him by pretending to be a high-ranking Liberation Front agent. Prove your credentials by 'tipping him off' about the pursuit of another agent, Ben Avis, to get him to disarm the bomb.

8. **Elias Hall's Keen Investigation** - Complete Episode 8
    - You are interrogated. Success requires defending your methods without admitting to illegal acts or sympathy for the Front.

9. **Now or Never** - Complete Episode 9
    - Interrogate pairs of leaders. Anaba-Reed is a recommended pairing.

10. **Decapitating Hydras** - Complete Episode 10
    - Final confrontation. Must get each leader to betray the others.

## Tips and Strategies

### General Gameplay Tips

1. **Understanding Cause and Effect**: Every action has consequences. Small dialogue choices accumulate to determine available options later.
2. **Interrogation Strategies**: Study suspect backgrounds carefully. Balance fear and openness. Failed interrogations often provide information for successful retries.
3. **Managing Multiple Meters**: It's nearly impossible to maintain perfect ratings. Decide early which reputation aspects matter for your playthrough.
4. **Efficient Achievement Hunting**: Use Challenge Mode for the first playthrough, then Narrative Mode for cleanup. Episode 2 is good for failure-related achievements.

### Key Deception & Manipulation Moments

Success in this game often hinges on specific moments of psychological manipulation. Here are key examples from the playthrough:

1. **The 'Vigilante Justice' Ploy (Episode 2):** With Darrell Peterson, agreeing with his views on 'vigilante justice' and the 'filth' in the world makes him see you as an ideological ally, causing him to reveal his connection to the Liberation Front.
2. **The 'Nanobots' Ploy (Episode 7):** When interrogating the mentally unstable Alex Novak, feeding his paranoia is more effective than trying to ground him in reality. Telling him 'the nanobots have reached your brain' completely breaks his psyche, but in his fractured state, he repeats key phrases told to him by the true culprit, Father Adams, including the order to buy 'nitromethane.'
3. **The 'Undercover Agent' Ploy (Episode 7):** With the factory owner King, a successful path involves a complex deception where you pretend to be a fellow Liberation Front member, proving your loyalty by sacrificing another agent. This shows how high-level manipulation can be more effective than direct threats.

### Thematic Dialogue and Character Voices

Pay close attention to how characters speak. The writing style is a deliberate clue to their background and vulnerabilities.

- **Street Slang:** Criminals like Jerry Cox use slang ("broseph," "ain't steal no bikes"), indicating a less formal background.
- **Ideological Jargon:** Educated leaders like Anaba Lee and Darrell Peterson use ideological language ("military-industrial complex," "the filth will drown us all"). Matching their language can build rapport.
- **Psychological Tics:** The mentally unstable Alex Novak speaks in cryptic, repeated phrases. Recognizing these as things he's been told by others is key to cracking his case.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Can I get all achievements in one playthrough?

A: No. At minimum, you need one Challenge Mode playthrough and additional playthroughs or save manipulation for all five endings and mutually exclusive achievements.

### Q: Do I need to use torture to complete the game?

A: No. The game can be completed without any "enhanced interrogation techniques." In fact, avoiding it is required for certain outcomes.

### Q: What's the difference between Challenge Mode and Narrative Mode?

A: Challenge Mode has stricter time limits and more resistant suspects. Narrative Mode is more forgiving and better for most achievement hunting.

### Q: Can I change my choices after making them?

A: You can restart failed interrogations. Between episodes, choices are permanent unless you load an earlier save.

### Q: How important are the team management sections?

A: Very important. They affect mission success, available options, multiple achievements, and public perception.

### Q: Which memories/traits should I choose?

A: This depends entirely on your intended playstyle and the ending you are aiming for. Choose traits that align with your strategy (e.g., Pacifist for empathy runs, Messiah Complex for the execution ending).

### Q: Is there a "best" ending?

A: No. Each ending represents a different philosophical approach to extremism. The game intentionally avoids presenting any solution as definitively correct.

## Final Notes

"Interrogation: You Will Be Deceived" is a game that rewards careful thought, multiple playthroughs, and moral flexibility. While this guide provides the mechanical steps to achieve all endings and achievements, the true experience comes from grappling with the ethical dilemmas presented.
