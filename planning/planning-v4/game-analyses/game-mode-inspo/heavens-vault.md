# Heaven's Vault Game Overview

Presenters: John and Joe

## Game Concept

- Narrative adventure game featuring archaeologist Elia Alassar
- Set in the Nebula world with ancient language translation mechanics
- Players explore lost archaeological sites and decipher inscriptions

## Key Characters

- Elia Alassar: Archaeologist protagonist (cautious, not superhuman like Lara Croft)
- Ipig Six: Robot companion with secret past

## Core Gameplay Mechanics

- Language System: Ancient language created from individual glyphs/symbols
- Players choose translations for ancient words
- ~1,000 words total, some system-generated combinations
- No right/wrong feedback - player interpretation drives narrative
- Inspired by hieroglyphics but simplified for gameplay

## Art Style

- 3D environments with 2D hand-drawn characters
- ~5,000 hand-drawn frames by single artist
- Functional character design (normal shoes, not fantasy gear)

## Game Structure

- Similar to The Witness: explore space, find puzzles
- All puzzles feed into narrative
- Player translations affect dialogue options
- Timeline system tracks discoveries and 4,500+ years of world history
- Progress from recent to ancient sites (backwards storytelling)

## Development Notes

- Originally more pictorial/comic book style
- Balancing difficulty without being too harsh was challenging
- Coming to PlayStation and Steam

## Comparison Note

Chants of Sennaar does this concept better - cleaner isometric style, more contextual puzzles, no word suggestions (context clues only)

And just to be a little bit more clear about this, the way that it goes is similar to Chants of Sennaar, where you come across a glyph or something in an archway in a book on the ground or somewhere, and then you have to translate it, and, you know, it's a puzzle. You can use the context clues to kind of figure it out, and you can guess, and then later on, it can confirm or deny. Literally, Chants of Sennaar is the same, but does it better.
