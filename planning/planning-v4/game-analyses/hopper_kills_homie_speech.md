# Hopper Kills Homie Speech

(BAND PLAYS LA CUCARACHA)

WATERSKIING GRASSHOPPER: Look at me! I'm barefooting!

SUNBATHING GRASSHOPPER: Yo, bugito! Dos granitos, pronto!

WATERSKIING GRASSHOPPER: You gotta try this, man!

GRASSHOPPERS: La cucaracha, la cucaracha, da da da da da da...

GRASSHOPPER: We have more than enough food, and if we go all the way back there and it starts to rain, we might as well be suckin' bug spray.

MOLT: Ooh! Don't even say that! You know somethin'? You're making a lot of sense. I mean, why take the risk? You should tell Hopper.

GRASSHOPPER: Good idea! But, you know, it's really not our place. I mean, you're his brother. That makes you, like, uh... The vice president of the gang.

MOLT: Wow! It kind of does, doesn't it? Okay, I'll tell him. Boy, I should talk to you guys more often.

GRASSHOPPER: What if Hopper doesn't like it?

GRASSHOPPER: Then at least the genius will get smacked, and not us.

MOLT: Vice President Molt. Yeah, that's good. Oh, that's good.

HOPPER: A little lower. Lower, lower.

MOLT: Heya, Hop.

HOPPER: Go away.

MOLT: That's fine. Then I won't tell you my idea.

HOPPER: Good!

MOLT: Okay, okay. I'll tell you anyway. You see, I've been thinking, okay, which is something that I do. You know, being vice president and all. And thi-this is a thought, and it was mine: why go back to Ant Island at all? I mean, you don't even like grain.

HOPPER: What?!

MOLT: You're right. I didn't think it was such a good idea, myself. Actually, it wasn't even my idea. It was Axle and Loco's! They talked fancy to me. I got confused!

La cucaracha

HOPPER: Guys... Order another round, because we're stayin' here!

-Yeah!

-Yeah!

HOPPER: What was I thinking? Going back to Ant Island. I mean, we just got here, and we have more than enough food to get us through the winter, right? Why go back?

(SINGING FOR HE'S A JOLLY GOOD FELLOW)

HOPPER: But...there was that ant that stood up to me.

GRASSHOPPER: Yeah, but we can forget about him!

GRASSHOPPER: Yeah, it was just one ant.

GRASSHOPPER: Ooh! One ant!

HOPPER: (laughs) Yeah, you're right! It's just one ant!

GRASSHOPPER: Yeah, boss! Heh. They're puny!

HOPPER: Hmm. Puny. Say, let's pretend this grain is a puny little ant.

HOPPER: Did that hurt?

GRASSHOPPER: (chuckles) Nope.

HOPPER: Well, how 'bout this one?

GRASSHOPPER: Are you kiddin'?

HOPPER: Well, how 'bout this?

[Hopper breaks open the bottle and the three grasshoppers are buried under an avalanche of grain.]

GRASSHOPPERS: (screaming, fades)

HOPPER: You let one ant stand up to us, then they all might stand up. Those puny little ants outnumber us a hundred to one. And if they ever figure that out, there goes our way of life! It's not about food. It's about keeping those ants in line. That's why we're going back!

[Hopper's antenna twitches.]

HOPPER: Does anybody else want to stay?

[The remaining grasshoppers open their wings.]

MOLT: He's quite the motivational speaker, isn't he?

HOPPER: Let's ride!

[Hopper and the grasshopper swarm fly off.]
