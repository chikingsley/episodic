          [Music] [Music] [Music] okay hey folks welcome back to after-work gaming we are here playing interrogation you will be deceived it's a new game just came out from critique gaming and mixed vision and really the only thing I know is you're a cop the whole thing is to interrogate suspects and it sort of follows in the footsteps of Orwell in being sort of a text-based puzzle game and that's kind of all I know and I'm excited to check it out so here let's do a little late-night let's play and get to it
          
          so welcome this will be the first drill session of the investigative interview and interrogation technique or so I'm sorry interrogation techniques course we'll be bringing in a subject there your trained actor but should be fully intact for the duration of the interview I'm considered invisible and inaudible by the actor but will be guiding you along before any interrogation the first thing to do is to consult the subjects file this should give you vital insight into the case helping you to identify
          
          what information or confessions need to be extracted okay incident narrative Douglas Byrd is played by an actor as per the instruction instructors directions treat the actor the same as you would a real suspect mr. bird despite coming from well-off parents has taken to bike theft we have plenty of circumstantial evidence because none of it is direct however we need to leverage all the leads in order to get a full confession hey Douglas bird charge of theft suspect by Oh Douglas bird is our main suspect
          
          for several bicycle thefts at a local university campus several eyewitnesses confirmed his description we also have CCTV footage showing a masked figure matching the suspects description jumping on an unsupervised bicycle and riding off fast he is currently listed as unemployed living in a rented apartment paid for his paperwork by his parents his criminal record is clean but he is known to be friends with several narcotics abusers as well as a roommate who is a suspected marijuana dealer okay when you're done checking the files you
          
          can bring in the subject be careful though now is not the case but when it will be time-sensitive situation this is when the clock starts ticking maybe that's where it is okay bring him in okay so first things first let's just try and straight-up ask him you can check the accusation question every now and then to get a sense of whether you're close to a confession all right let's talk about writing a confession both know you did it come on they look at you in disbelief we don't know nothing I'm not signing
          
          nothing nah all right too early for that let's keep working on him so why do you steal bikes Douglas they say with a smart aah I ain't steal no flex broseph Atlas right so that's surprisingly didn't work we need to get the subject in the right state of mind to give us answers so how do we do that well we have the following tools which we can use to see what state the subject is in this shows us how open the subject is by looking at pupil dilation corroborated with a few other signals but why do the pupils are the
          
          more open the subject is this meter tells us how scared the subject is by measuring pulse as well as other bodily symptoms the quicker the heart rate the more scared the subject is now you can influence these meters by in all sorts of ways from building a personal connection to exploiting their background from cornering them in contradictions to roughing them up well let's try build a connection first be careful some questions will alienate the subject instead of bringing them closer other questions will seem disingenuous
          
          if they're approached too suddenly you'll probably want to start off as soft as possible ok says in your file your folks are loaded what's the matter they cut you off no loaded you steal for fun no a livings expensive I know I used to crack payphones when I was a teen let's keep that in the back pocket can't believe they have me chasing bikes why can't people just lock them up proper let's do this one just musing you know they seem amused it's [ __ ] stupid man waste taxpayer money and all that ok
          
          good you seem more authentic now get closer to the subject ok that's what we do this whole cracking payphones they say with a tinge of disbelief weren't as thug trained actor huh okay we have I'm opening up some good this is why the meter now shows a wider circle than in the beginning now let's see how you can try and scare you want to intimidate but don't jump to big threats right off the bat don't be afraid to ask a question more than once asking again with the subject in a different state of mind or
          
          with new information on the table can yield new results alright if we don't have a deal and you're found guilty it's absolutely prison time but I can only give you a deal if you plead guilty all right let's hold that to the side the drugs make you do it no you know how many months you do for a bike theft and hey you're tough you'll be fine in prison I'm sure okay let's start with this one again we're just musing you know hey you know how many months and then if he if we if that works maybe we'll hit him with this one you know
          
          like yeah but don't worry about it you'll be fine right just again just musing boom bikes they stay timidly nah man no I I am worried about that okay so there are signs of fear we're on to something okay good now we're gonna hit him with this prison thing but I'm sure you'll be fine they void your gaze well what what you don't know time for snatching bikes do you my dad works for a senator you know I'll be fine or will he sometimes talk reveals new information that you can further pursue and it's in yellow so oh you think the
          
          senator will risk his career for the sake of a bike snatching kid really is shifting their seat in this stress but probably not [ __ ] [ __ ] there we go we're getting there now let's put them in a good place to negotiate no I you know you gonna have to cut a deal with me man they seem concerned but like I mean what what a deal be like okay we got them as you can see his pulse is much faster right now nice okay now this is off the record but I want you to know your options at any time you can stop the
          
          recorder tracking your questioning really this will make people suspicious the public will ask what happened when the recording was stopped you'll be accused but ultimately it's your word against theirs in a pinch though it's something to consider you have means of an enhanced interrogation that can get a subject scared try a couple out the actor will just pretend to be hurt I have to go to the wall and pray I can do a lot more to your neck than grabbing it and let's hear the elect truth my god
          
          all right let's grab them boom they breathe heavily distressed and displeased I'm not playing here say to my face oh whoa it's a lot of different ones okay maybe you'd rather tell the wall tell us to the great wall of truth maybe it'll be more open open once pinned up a [Music] electrocution on to truth alright fine doing this closing them off yeah I'll bet but as you can see now they're terrified beware that if you continue roughing them up they might pass out start the recorder again when you're
          
          done yeah I'm done okay sometimes you'll be interrogating against the clock when that's the case keep your eyes on the timer sometimes you'll be interrogating more than one guy switch between the rooms and be sure to cross-reference the information they give you okay anyway you'll get to keep your manual after you finish the Academy it's great for refreshing your memory about what you learned today including the whole tasering m right okay okay now to wrap this up we're ready to get a confession
          
          with the accusation question boom they seem concerned why no no no I would like I would that involved though alright we almost got him we just have to press him the right way there are ways in which you press an open subject and other ways in which you press a terrified subject like this one hey look you'll be fine we'll help you compensate the victims make things right ready to sign a confession that feels more like an open subject listen you lowlife sign this damn confession right now maybe we can
          
          keep your dumb ass out of jail boom they say in this bear [ __ ] man [ __ ] [ __ ] okay okay alright I'll sign they should accomplished less chief Anderson hey I need you to come in on a case fishes brought in a set of guys they are in the interrogation rooms mark IA chief Anderson we have the Vics husband the only witness and the robber that broke in we need your questioning magic in there a confession because all we have is circumstantial you win yes sir so the story is this [ __ ] broken armed with a
          
          low-cal piece holding this Peterson up and trying to do it and tying into a chair wife comes in jumps on the phone Cox drops her with two shots to the back before bolting we have the gun no prints Mordecai this Peterson was as cool as a cucumber his wife's body just lying in the other room managed to track them and also grab Cox Street contacts helped chief Anderson but we still don't have a clear picture of the murder anyway check out the files grill them cross-examination give me confession you
          
          have this all right thanks chief he seemed really not chillon okay 57 Santa Monica Avenue burglary breaking an entry and a homicide victim is Heather Peterson okay incident narrative Heather Peterson was murdered in a living room in front of her husband Darrell Peterson he was found tied down in a chair in the same room he claims a burglar broke in and armed with a low caliber gun threatened them tied them up and subsequently shot mr. Peterson as she tried to use her cell phone using the description provided in a tip from a
          
          local pawn shop what we managed to track down the burglar one jerry munch [ __ ] and apprehend him the gun was found outside the building the other fire escape TV used to enter and leave the premises the evidence of the burglary is clear but we still don't have a full picture of the murder which Munch strongly denies committing what complicates things is mr. Darrell Peterson's attitude the first detective on the scene described him as disturbingly serene our best hope of closing the case fast and clean is an
          
          admission of guilt munch and Peterson have both been held for questioning you have been tasked with extracting a confession okay so Jerry Cox breaking and entering and burglary suspects by Oh Jerry Cox alias munch has been identified as the burglar who broke into the Peterson's apartment the night of the murder his criminal record is quite colorful includes car theft pickpocketing burglary and credit card fraud a high-school dropout with no current employment munch is well-known to the local police
          
          Megan he is the main suspect and has been directly accused of tying down the couple and shooting the wife possibly impossibly under stress when she reached for her phone while circumstantial evidence in the husband's testimony points to munch as the murderer it is not sufficient for a conviction he does not have a past record of violent crime of any sort munch has previously taken plea bargains and can perhaps be pressured into doing so again okay and the meantime we've got Darryl Peterson suspect Darryl Peterson is the husband
          
          of the victim although we usually avoid involving family members of the recently deceased in an investigation he is the sole witness of the murder and as such as a key asset he has voluntarily agreed to be interviewed Peterson's reports so far has been accurate and led to the arrest of the burglar the main suspect for the murder jerry munch Cox however the police officer of the first unit at the scene reported Peterson displaying unusual calm and composure this is a suspicious degree of detachment for someone
          
          emerging from such a traumatic and stressful situation this raises some concerns yet Peterson has a clean record and there is no evidence that points to any wrongdoing on his part okay all right well bring him in hello okay that's Cox Peterson let's work with Cox first talk about yourself talk about the burglary talk about the murder be honest with me who killed mr. Peterson no no no let's talk about you man they stay calmly no need to mr. me around chief you can call me munch yeah are you from the city tinge of smiles
          
          shows in the corner of her eyes born and raised in this pisshole yeah I like this think of it you know you know let's think of it now you know okay where do you work should we notify them do you have friends or family they state sadness seeping through their voice don't you drag them into it but I got a cousin probably worried about me oh really sure tracked on the cousin see if he can corroborate your story now let's try and open him up very well if you write down his phone number or address we'll make
          
          sure he knows you were safe they state with a tinge of disbelief and the boys thanks chief but I'd rather he didn't get into trouble looking for me just leave him out of this okay okay let's not go straight there where do you work should we notify him they say with pride and her voice none I worked for me around unless you like bringing food to rich people's tables and I don't like that I'm too smart for it you know you say are currently unemployed no friends you from the city all right the second into his crimes yet
          
          but something else he nods I'm sure we will all right we'll talk about the burglary we'll talk about the burglary they state defensively I don't get what all the fuss is about okay look I got that much out of it really did you take they state with a small chuckle first thing I could lay my hands on who at the bag didn't notice until later at a couple of small bushes or trees or toward or something I'll give you one if we can wrap this up yeah what points did you run away were you aware there were people inside why did

Cox you had no reason to care about these people you were going down for this anyway don't waste my time and I will make sure you don't do the max no no see anybody else still trying to be nice they stay blankly I didn't see anyone the street was empty and I ran away as soon as I heard voices inside

          there's no need for that they fired me months ago I bet they did where did you used to work they stay calmly in a carpet I'm a carpenter by trade I used to work at Annika lute hmm a nearby Furniture Factory why did you get fired sir anger smoldering in their gaze I worked here there for six years but the boss wanted to hire cheaper labor and you know how these big corporations are soulless a lot of them so your wife was the primary earner it look away well yes if you want to put it like that she was quite proud of it
          
          too rah rubbed it in my face with each opportunity she had job hunt must be frustrating I hope you find one soon say yes it was I despised all that ass kissing and self boasting nut everyone understands I'm with you ma'am did you say used to work okay I'm getting there I'm getting there then you got fired from me I don't like talking about chefs chat no whoa hello in your wife argued often and she blamed you for not at all he's not open yet you're not a registered gun owner okay talk about the gun they state
          
          defensively state's legislation doesn't say I need to register her I bought it at a gun fair anyone what about it why not report the Sooners quite dubious you and hunt know why didn't you try to use the gun in self-defense they stay calmly I can reach it in time I was even waiting for an opportunity to test my aim on Filth like him so were you were prepared for such an event I speak with permission of course I was the way things are going in this city everyone should be prepared you are an officer
          
          you know how dangerous the streets have become with all the crackheads the crazy hobos you need to be ready hey I understand your concerns but most people don't have the stomach to shoot even in self-defense you think it would have been able to most people don't wish they had an opportunity to test their aim on a human being Peterson what if he killed a burglar no you have the stomach let him boast of himself a little the voice Quivers with anger yes when the system doesn't protect you you have to
          
          do it yourself if we had an armed neighbor watt and a neighborhood watch filth like that burglar wouldn't have dared to step on our streets why did you not report it sooner so you say you could not reach so you were prepared for such an event I don't even want to hear about the whole dubiousness quite harsh views you have mr. Peterson do you really think this burglar deserves to die a state where salutely while crossing their arms hell yes with some people there's no alternative you have to take things into your own hands and
          
          get it and get tough only way this world will ever be better a better place if is if honest people stand up with force if necessary vigilante justice you think that's the solution to fix you with the stair there is so much filth out there and the system that supports that supported so it's supposed to clean a cochlea is just as dirty if honest people like you and me don't take action the filth will drown us all it is the only solution just you and main that won't change much don't you think their voice is booming
          
          with energy there's many of us out there who think like this we found each other online like-minded people willing to take up the responsibility to do the right thing we what are you talking about a political platform they start speaking faster no no politics is their game if we play by their rules we lose because it's a rigged game we need to short-circuit the whole system shake up the entire establishment it takes coordinated effort though how will that happen they state calmly there's this group I was talking about
          
          we mostly meet online forums boards chat rooms it's a great tool to organize ourselves plan things out which sort of plans to be talking about beaks with confidence and conviction I don't know for sure I don't have the right to chat rooms where things are organized but it will certainly be big I don't you have access to the chat rooms the shrug need to show some commitment beforehand and to depart to be part of the group for a while I asked for access but I'm sure I'll get it soon so who has access
          
          he smiles the chat rooms are anonymous of course we know each other by our IDs mostly veterans people that have been involved for a long time they sign a mentor to new people - Horn Bunny 49 silly name I know what needs to be discussed in such secrecy he smiles aha I don't know for sure but it's the place where they assign actual tasks and set up meetings things are picking up were simply it's all very exciting to be part of the Liberation Front okay that's some sort of groups name stay blankly no one voted on it or
          
          anything it's just what we call it okay into a smile shows the cords fries you want some links to the forums I'll give them to you after we're done here let's just ask this real quick mm-hmm have you ever heard of this Liberation Front they offered confused look that a gang or something no never heard of them must be new okay fine extreme views your wife argued often she blamed you for getting fired okay let's not talk about that yet there's some questions about your wife think about these online friends of yours yeah anger
          
          flickers in his eyes she did not approve he gives her another reason to Chris as me all those arguments uh-huh did she get along with her colleagues they stayed spitefully oh yes she's a great care of make everyone love her there I think that's why her boss didn't fire her as mine did in this economy hard-working skills are not enough it's all politics but the neighbors know now is comic no no she even organized a gardening group with a few of them they planted those nice flowers in front of the house okay do you think anyone would
          
          what had plans for harming her they stayed in high pitch what of course not that bastard that broke into our home didn't know either of us it was usually a band of their attempt if there are people at home this one didn't and I'm wondering what you would be so stupid and the burglar had a rope a load of gun and escape plan all that effort no no no no it's sarcastic who said anything about the burglar we keep an open chest with no no this one didn't and I'm wondering what he would be so stupid give him a chance to vent some more
          
          anger at me they stayed with spike those sort of people don't think straight they just can't do dump for it probably why he ended up a criminal to begin with okay I can't imagine myself getting married they frowned cool I really don't care man we were you were being buds here okay and why think about these online friends are things in your marriage state warmly we've been married for almost seven years it had its ups and downs is you would expect my file says you don't have children do you have
          
          but do you have any children the argument you had on the night of the attack what was the common in your relationship so I understand that you and your wife had frequent disagreements lately let's ask about this real quick they say calmly no children are a waste of time don't you think interesting no no no the attack was that common they state sadness in the voice we weren't on the best of terms we had been fighting quite often about the most stupid things you know how it goes that I guess both of us thought we would
          
          settle it when the time was right then you and your wife had phrased it so this was frequently frequent recently these people the steady careful wording yes many fights started with her criticizing me especially about had not having a job she blamed me for it constantly as if the current state of the job market did not matter one bit okay nothing new here no but then let's talk about your gun say spitefully I don't understand why you care so much about that as I said I keep it so that it can stop scum from hurting me or my
          
          family they say you'd not reach it so you were prepared such an event ok so there's nothing new were you and your wife doing that night before it'll happened like to know about the detail so now let's talk about the wife thing we were watching TV when the bastard came in through the window was anyone else in the house the shrug umm yes just s what do you mean are you sure there was nobody else in the house so I asked again could anybody have thought that you intended to leave the house but the doors locked the lights on
          
          they stayed blankly yes the doors were locked and the lights were on in the living room so the burglar tried the door first no no no so it was clear to anyone on the outside someone was in the house the burglar still came in it's it's so troubling to be attacked in the safety of your home behind locked doors I'm very sorry mr. Peterson yes let's do that one across their arms all we can do now is make sure the bastard gets what he deserves I hope he hangs mr. Cox says that the lights were off are you lying mr. Cox
          
          says that the lights were off but they're probably confused by their lives Oh roll their eyes dumb thieves are dumb yeah it's dumb people yes mr. Peterson so mr. Peterson mites going off again where the doors locked lights on did anyone I thought you were intended to leave the house sure there was nobody else in the house outside the two of you I don't think I asked this one they stayed after thinking for a second hmm now that I think about it we were supposed to go out for dinner we always do that on Friday nights a silly habit
          
          of ours ended up staying home though and why didn't you leave this i weakened it to an argument a big one to keep us a big enough one to keep us at home okay then let's talk about the timeline okay whoa this is long much claims he does not own a gun and there's no evidence of tying him to one we get there jerem coming in they stay blankly no not really we were arguing quite loudly okay when did you first see him stay to have to pause it for a second to think when he entered the living room and where
          
          were you and your wife when he when you first saw him we were in the living room is this relevant to the investigate it's relevant to the investigation and what point did the burglar pull out the gun he had his gun when he burst in really how did you react when you saw it they calmly I put my hands up of course I told him that he could take whatever he wanted as long as he did not hurt us he claims he doesn't have a gun and there's no evidence tying him to one boys correct well he's certainly lying
          
          or perhaps he stole mine I keep it in the bedroom really okay so one news Friday now did you provoke him in any way threaten him somehow why did he huh why did he tie you down they call me out I guess he was scared I would try to fight him off and why do you tie your wife down yes he was telling her to sit down and she darted towards the phone that's when he shot her did you provoke him or anything they spy for you look bastards like him are the reason I keep a gun they deserve a bullet in the head nothing less but he
          
          did not threaten him in any way hmm okay I mean I'm almost positive that he's the one who did it and he's pretty susceptible to confession right now plot I bet the incidents timeline let's talk about some more about your gun doing the night before I have some more questions about your wife okay let's talk about you real quick is the fact that it was in the bedroom is a problem you know about the burglary run away now trees now think about the Liberation Front now let's talk about the murder again did
          
          you happen to know the victims were before the event did you feel threatened by the couple blankly I'm sure they're nice people but I haven't seen them spoken to them or even sent them a text that's a long way of saying no hey [ __ ] some more about this gun the weapon is in yours it you were the only one at the scene that doesn't add up in this pair chief ask anyone go search my home do whatever you want I never had a gun I don't even know how to use one anyone could have dropped it there okay and how
          
          can I know it's not yours mate with a hangar in every bush I don't know man what about the whole innocent until proven guilty thing okay look the woman was shot in cold blood registration can be faultless wise but not by me you got to believe me maybe you panicked pull the trigger accidentally again you see somebody else in or around the house when you were in there mr. Cox you got no reason to care about these people you're going down for this anyway don't waste my time and I'll make sure you don't go to met and do the
          
          max when you were in there see anybody else if I had told you I didn't see anyone well then maybe you pulled the trigger out of panic it look at your anger in their eyes what triggered panic by what you ain't pinning this on me no matter how hard you try okay anything else no okay it's more about your gun you and your wife argued she blame you for getting fired smile annoyance it with yes yes she was relentless about it mostly blame me for it wouldn't believe me that my boss was a bastard that he had it in for me women
          
          like her always think they know everything hello I assumed you were fighting over this on the night that break-in as well right shrugs stiffly actually yes that's what started it that night as well it was a common thing for us it must have been so frustrating too for you her constant pestering now Santa stop bullying me Peterson it's obvious to anyone that you resented her of what she did it must've been so frustrating man it looked lost in thought yes I guess it was I just had enough you know you've been in with
          
          someone for seven years you expect some respect by that point some consideration but no she could be such a shrew sometimes I'm telling you so that's why you seem so composed about the situation who actually hated her there was lowers to a near whisper I I did yes I'm not happy she died but I can't help but feel relief that she will be blaming me for all the things that went wrong okay anything left just check this one real quick we keep on extending extreme I keep on saying this is the only reasonable perspective any man can have
          
          [Music] let's go through the timeline one more time they stay praising I brought what else do you want to know how did you say you reacted when you saw the gun so you say that you wanted to tie it down your way to do whatever you need yeah let's talk honestly now huh as we know I stayed there voice shaking what what do you mean that that damn burglar who do you think killer to me it's clear you have no love for your wife you resent her I would go so far as to say you hate her their voice is wavering she I did
          
          hate her yes I hated her arrogance I hated her friends I hate her [ __ ] bonsai trees I hated the disrespect she had for me but that doesn't mean I would have ever hurt her yeah and even more that night you had an argument and you also saw a huge opportunity to blame the murder on the burglar you spotted coming in is that right they blabber what how I I mean you've made it quite clear you see violence as a solution Peterson you talk with your friends online about it you have the means and the motive to do
          
          it if you believe in justice as you say confess and listen Peterson I have you on record saying that you hated your wife and that you planned dangerous activities online if you don't confess I'll make sure you're convicted for terrorist intent and you rot in prison for the rest of your miserable life I don't know this is a man of honor and integrity who apparently runs on a bunch of shady ass online chat rooms so let's go and just say he should confess cuz justice tears start coming out of his angry eyes she she should've treated me
          
          with more respect she deserved it and so does my stupid boss and so do many others if we don't take things into our own hands nothing will ever change I thought you understood that too there we are interrogations successful but the confession secured Darryl Peterson will be going to jail for a long time what is this liberation front business though and there I think we'll stop because this has been a little longer than I expect for a late night let's play but I am 100% in on this game if you guys want to see more of it by all
