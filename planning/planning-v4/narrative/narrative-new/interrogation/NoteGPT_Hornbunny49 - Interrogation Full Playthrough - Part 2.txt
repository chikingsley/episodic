          hey folks welcome back to after work gaming we are back or more interrogation you will be deceived so after that late night let's play I was all-in on this game so let's just go ahead and continue now last time during the late night let's play we found out that this guy murdered his wife we also found out that he has some ties to this Liberation Front which he found online and it sounds like a like an extremist group that he may or may not be a part of or that he wanted to join okay so let's just go ahead interrogation successful
          
          with the confession secure at Darryl Peterson will be going to jail for a long time what is this Liberation Front business though and here's our chief chief Anderson good work in there I have something important I need to discuss with you but before that I need to finish up the press release we're putting out about this case help them out I help the word it then come see me okay st pd press release the investigation involving the murder of Heather Peterson was concluded today which resulted in the arrest of Darryl Peterson 41 and
          
          Jerry Cox 26 now Jerry Cox was just some guy who was burglarizing the house if you remember all evidence pertaining to the case has been directed to the relevant authorities with a full cooperation council of the st pd prosecutor counselor okay they will be treated following judicial procedure and their cases will be taken to Criminal Court or the criminals have been incarcerated I don't know they'll be treated subject to judicial procedure Darryl Peterson husband not initially suspect the main
          
          suspect the victim's husband let's just go ahead the victims husband confessed to the murder during questioning although he initially attempted to hide his involvement by staging a violent robbery evidence found at the scene contradicted parts of his description of the event the police will be advancing charges of voluntary manslaughter first degree murder voluntary manslaughter for the murder it's not really a crime of passion first-degree murder is like has got to be premeditated you really add voluntary
          
          manslaughter but it's not voluntary manslaughter voluntary manslaughter is if Jerry Cox had done it if you had broken in actually no I'm gonna take that back it was its literally if you like you walk in a room you see somebody and you go up and then shoot him that's close to voluntary manslaughter the reason it wouldn't be is because Jerry Cox is a burglar burglar with a gun elevates it burglar with a gun who shoots someone elevates it burglar with a gun to shoot someone he kills someone is a felony murder so I think so first
          
          thing we murder I'm just I'm this is just stuff I picked up due to the confession the manslaughter charges against Jerry Cox have been dropped and he will only face prosecution for breaking and entering and theft there you go his involvement in creating the circumstances for the murder to happen will be investigated further he'll no evidence is Jesse had no violent debt no connection the murder who cares this to involvement with the granderson and I find no violent intent moving on pick an old memory speed demon
          
          speed demon you have more time to interrogate cannot access files during or before interrogations [ __ ] will do it live and now we're not going to do that rofo I guess this is like so this is like RPG style we get to advance our skills right profile our reading reactions and emotional states and asides to you do you have an exact evaluation in numbers of how fearful and empathetic the subjects are people's dilated satisfactory nope intimidating presence you have mastered the use of threats and silenced to cow your
          
          subjects a dog that barks as a dog insufficiently boiled hmm and may be known pacifists do you always follow procedure and are known for it subjects have more empathy towards you but you have trouble frightening them and cannot use enhanced interrogation right last time we found out that we can basically torture that torture well we can rough up the suspects we can taste them or throw them against the wall or basically just give em a good shake we do this by the book or else we're no different from
          
          them hmm scholar of ideology you have keenly studied extremist ideology and may use that knowledge when taking when talking to people with radical convictions in the end we will strike back against ourselves I kind of want to get this because I feel like this is probably where the game is going so we're gonna go with that okay scholar of ideology moving on hey chief you Fenderson this liberation front business you've got out of petersen it seems to be pretty serious stuff we've been claiming more and more

          that continue s TPD press release in response to the emergency that the terrorist organization that identified cefalu Liberation Front nope the recent upsurge in terrorist activity maybe yeah we're not gonna identify them in the press release because we don't want to spook them now they're already spooked but we're not gonna say anything especially if their followers don't necessarily all know the SDPD assembled thee east instability retribution and justice truth and order peace and stability that seems like the
          
          kind of thing that they would do special unit in order to counter at this threat STP DPS and Intel a PSU ESS you may be an intelligence gathering operation of the respective unit has led to the interview and eventual arrest of Freddie nice and confessed sympathizer a suspected collaborator suspected collaborator he's not a confessed sympathizer and I'll tell you why again it's to not let anybody know of a terrorist cell the two other suspects have been interviewed as part of the same investigation but they have been
          
          released having proven their innocence due to lack of evidence against them due to the lack of evidence against them along with his conviction a confession Fred eNOS is interview also yielded relevant information regarding the terrorist organization the password to secure chip why would you ever write that ma'am relevance information regarding the terrorist organization thank you the officers in charge of the investigation are hopeful that this information will be useful in preventing future terrorist
          
          attacks chi-ching and for a great job in their boss now that we're logged in even for a second we can analyze that we've been talking what they've been talking about at a first glance they seem to be using code words I can set up a smart algorithm that can detect possible meanings from the contextual usage of words or we can simply try to figure it out directly I don't trust algorithms Jennifer look at their conversations and try and figure out what they've been talking about those may be deceiving to the
          
          naked eye let the algorithms do the work tell me what pops up do both set up the algorithm and also try to figure out manually why wouldn't you do both why would you not do both don't give me that look at this will mean that both of us will be busy working on this we may have a hard time responding to other issues that pop up do both anyway we'll see what bites fine forget the algorithm then intuition will be our weapon okay let the computers do the work then no to both we are a crack squad of the ST PD
          
          okay we are the best of the best and we are trying to root out terrorism we got to do everything there is no tool that we do not use boom chief as part of leading your team you'll have to manage budget and assign missions you're budgeting and you'll be getting $2,000 with each budget round you can influence your available funds in many ways and any sums unspent are saved for the next budget round you can assign available agents to missions on top of their core investigation work for the team how well
          
          they'll do is determine by how motivated they are and how much the task fits their background and expertise I've ordered you an outsource HR report it's on me it should tell you how well the agents might do on missions if you don't buy yourself expanded HR reports in the future you won't know what their likelihood of success will be maintaining all facets of the image of your team is key you need approval or else you'll lose the team buying expanded PR reports can help you understand what's causing shifts in your
          
          image all set sounds like a lot how do I know what the consequences of each choice will be before I make them boom well you don't it's your job to evaluate the consequences of the risks in each of the actions and options might be use your reason use trial and error but this isn't the police academy things are not transparent and don't have fixed and easy predictable effects you think I hadn't any idea hitting on that redhead back in college would mean I now have to go to marriage counseling I had no idea
          
          that's what real life's like good luck all right chief don't don't use me to air out your whatever okay budget allocation order HR report comprehensive evaluation of the agents giving us an exact assessment of their morale level their compatibility the missions available as well as an as well as expanding their personnel file order extend PR report ordered detailed evaluation from the Burt slurm arson company of how key stakeholders currently view the task forces led by you PR assistance receive key advice and
          
          PR support from Burt's Lamar seed company towards our advertising the task force's efforts any positive light till forfeiture assign overtime to the agents in order to help other departments pursue cases that are likely to involve major civil forfeiture opportunities thus gaining access to the newly confiscated resources are in our team building take the other agents out to an evening of team-building civil forfeiture if you guys haven't seen there's a great John Oliver last week tonight episode about that some of the
          
          stuff that goes on with civil forfeiture is nuts I actually highly recommend it I'll probably put a link in the description just because it's interesting Co overtime assign overtime to the agents in order to participate in a community outreach program that has officers engaging with the at-risk youth this will allow the teens to gain a better understanding of police work and perhaps even gain interest in law enforcement Informer stimulants get the agent going on the pursue Informer mission extra
          
          budget to help motivate those that may hold information procedure training organized a training session for the agents to learn the latest techniques and procedures used by the department and therapy book a session with a specialized therapist helping law enforcement officers deal with the stresses commonly encountered in their line of work okay these are all tasks pursue informer hit the streets talk to people pressure existing contacts try to find someone that has intel line about has an intel
          
          line about this Liberation Front work with a district attorney to bring charges to the animal care chatroom hosts that the Liberation Front used have them pay damages at least for facilitating terrorist operations from plant would we waste our time but it like this is information gathering ok let the DEA do its thing or her thing by the book make sure everything done by the everything is done by the book right up detailed reports through the paperwork get all the permits and count and count from
          
          confirmations needed I'm sorry you're such a dramatic Isis go to the people whose pet chant pet shops have advertised for pet products and see if they have any information ok volunteer another help out the department deal with their workload why why there are terrorists running around ok formulate budget requests petition authorities file for deductibles optimize all you can to get some extra money into the next budget pack the murder weapon go into the field and try to track down the origin of Peterson's weapon that's
          
          possible that's interesting go home early nobody cares check go home early at the agents agent head home early that's maybe if they're really tired or something focus on chatroom analysis use all remaining available time on keeping the agents eyes and the chatroom discussions game and share an understanding of the people there and their objectives now here's the thing if they know right if they know that we are in the chat room won't Jennifer you can go ahead and pursue a chatroom among you hey see if they have any information we
          
          can track the murder weapon well hey Mordecai you will track the murder weapon because let's see where he got his gun right and then pursuing the informer 20% success and then 55% success man are you good at like what do you like your algorithm right you're like all whatever but by the book we get all the permits and confirmations needed no I want you guys working looks like the thing I want you doing stuff man [Music] 60% 55% but I want to focus on chatroom analysis and I want it as good as I can
          
          get rasuu Informer is only 20% which is unfortunately but the advertiser slave let's put you on the advertisers ok so this doesn't actually give me any money which is good now we can put money in here let's do the following let's go ahead now we're not doing anything with informers are used by the department no see over this will allow the teens to gain no if the event on a thing what we'll do it we'll do drinks later or something or during extended PA report HR comprar has a valuation the agents
          
          giving us an exact assessment of their moral level the compatibility with the mission available as well as expanding the personnel file let's do that and then therapy nobody really needs it right now we're not really doing anything overtime to the agents enter precipitate pretended to do no help motivate those that may hold information [Music] no because they're not doing pursuant formers again PR report nobody cares right now we're not really that deep into this take the other agents out for an evening or whatever
          
          okay well let's learn about the procedure training right because maybe that'll actually improve them a little bit right so let's continue chief we've got a report in I'm gonna ask you to try and answer a few of his questions Oh a reporter this is Eddie Walker from the heralding the greetings officer are you ready to get started I'll leave you to it chief we don't have a PR guy I got I got a book my own gigs all right let's make this snappy let me get my files first in case I need to get details let me clear
          
          the room first make sure we have some privacy the light will you know light is the bestest in fact where sunlight is the greatest disinfectant so let's get my files out what's up Eddie so first things first how does it feel to be assigned to lead to such an important task force I prefer to stick to discussing the technical questions please I'm not looking to talk about my feelings about the press it's an immense responsibility we'll put in an effort every day and every night to stop these bastards it's the police's
          
          responsibility to make the city safe again we've got the best people will deliver boom Eddie I don't like your face what sort of boss are you to your team I sort of lost mine I delegate a lot I have a great team and they can be trusted to make good decisions I follow the well-thought-out procedures and protocols of the PD prescribes for team management I give detailed instructions and inspiring a sense of discipline I make sure we're followed and I make sure they're followed to the letter you need
          
          to do so that means I'm in charge of everything I follow the well-thought-out procedures and protocols the PD describes for team management it's one of these two that can be trusted to make good decisions I have a really good team [Music] and these are all pretty good and none of these are like I'm screwing up as a committee you know I'm screwing up the image here I have a great team and they get me trusted to make good decisions let's go with that let's just keep the team cohesive right are you and your
          
          team prepared enough to take on this Duty yes experts like tap Thompson are some of the best available yes experienced officers like Jennifer Reyes yes we are we all try best we just hope it'll be enough no why are you saying that and why is this why do I have to choose you know what Jennifer Reyes why cuz she doesn't rely on computers and gadgets and gizmos boom shout out you're facing a threat that seems to have significant resources can you keep up with them logistically speaking the police department how do I know you're not
          
          connected the police department is committed to seeing safety restored yes we believe we can these people they don't need to follow the rules while we do hopefully the red tape won't cost lives such organizations try to create the appearance of wielding more power than they really have we'll get them boom I like this one bravado Eddie I do not like the way you look at me when I give you the answers all right Eddie Walker what comes first in your investigation disarming the pawns are getting to the leaders not
          
          answering that question boom the first step is surely disarming the pawns to keep people safe the only real way to really bring down them down will be to get to the leaders I'm afraid I can't share such strategic procedural details no I can't don't look at me like that this Liberation Front what do they want I want to give them as little airtime as possible it's what they want so no comment on a Liberation Front they seem to have a disjointed political ideology that preys on disaffection we're still
          
          trying to understand it a bunch of psychos that need to be stopped the rest is fluff no no comment on them thank you how can people at home help the task force task forces taking care of this people should report the boys in blue be vigilant be safe be alert and report suspicious behavior immediately this Liberation Front wants people scared refuse to be afraid go on with your life uninterrupted let's be vigilant alright let's just start pulling in details alright see something say something whatever other slogans there are what
          
          time frame are we looking at when will we be rid of this threat a point of our action is firstly to make people safe we'll do that for as long as it takes we'll crush these maggots before the end of the year there's still the initial phase of the operation we can't share any timeline details the point of our action is firstly to make people safe we'll do that for as long as it takes I kind of like that although you know if it turns out people start dying I'm gonna look like an idiot I don't want to
          
          say this this seems stupid it's a initial phases I don't want to say we're just getting started you know so we're gonna keep people safe for as long as it takes thank you for the interview officer and that like a lieutenant or anything I'm that I'm nothing all right for internal use only alright let's just read through this stuff mission report focus on chatroom analysis Jennifer Ria's success we understand how they work better blackmailing pressuring non-members is one of their methods so we might want to
          
          inquire about that in the interrogations soo chat remand for ties with Thompson we found them but they seem to be just trying to sell their products no discernible links the Liberation Front alright fine track the murder weapon the gun does that wait a minute if there's another one does that mean we can actually get another person is that what happens when we go to the overtime thing huh track the murder weapon Mordecai no in success everybody succeeded nice the gun was taken off of her street dealer not from a gun fair while they
          
          have no relevant info the confiscation of several illegal weapons he had on him means a bump in next month's department budget boom PR report popularity how much the residents of the city trust your department to protect them alright we're somewhere in the middle press approval how friendly the journalists are who write about your investigations the bettery Authority's approval how favorably institutions in the city are to the results you're getting excellent your HR report is ready files Declassified Herald operations manual I
          
          don't even know what that is alright HR report whoa hmm kind of well let's at least look at this stuff filed by Abigail mezco or Luke Sanderson named Jennifer Reyes observations extra aspects discovered in HR interviews are through background research have been added as classified entries to the agents file given the following and inter in into and integrating the agent's background success probabilities have been calculated motivation level high the subject is well motivated and intense pursues tasks to the best of
          
          their ability though fatigue may reduce efficiency cap Tom's yes see there's clearly space for another person app Thompson given the following integration of the agents background success probabilities have been calculated and it's still a motivation and tab Thompson Center or Mordecai is the same thing okay Jennifer Reyes alright well let's read these and I think then we'll probably put a pin in it Jennifer was born and raised in a quiet San Francisco suburbia heat her early educational records show excellent grades as well as
          
          her being active in numerous NGOs and youth sports clubs she was characterized as a highly ambitious driven and energetic young woman she applied for an engineering degree at a reputed ng at university over time her class attendance steadily dropped and with it her grades notes from the University psychologist showed that she was having trouble adapting to the new environment and underlined low levels of engagement and motivation Jenna put her studies on hold in her sophomore year joining a volunteer group
