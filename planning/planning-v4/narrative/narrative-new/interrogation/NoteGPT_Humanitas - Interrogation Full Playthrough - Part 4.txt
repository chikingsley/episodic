          folks welcome back to after-work gaming we are back for some more interrogation last time if you recall we managed to capture or prevent one bombing but unfortunately another one or another two went off in the city and as a result our popularity plummeted and all sorts of negative consequences and now I imagine we're sort of hot on the heels of whoever it is that set the bomb last time we sort of looked through all of these so I think we should just go ahead and continue and see what the next interrogation itself is gonna be
          
          Mordecai so we have some good news in some bad news good news is they had the elevator cameras there is set to take pictures after each press of a button there seems to have been a single press to go to the 13th floor bad news is they weren't stored digitally but printed crazy old-school security manager and the picture corresponding to the button press warrior interested in was missing of course in foul play likely what after several hours of trash digging pardon it by smell I was able to track down these
          
          scraps I brought them with me okay so that's one of these puzzles okay well there's any good puzzle let's go ahead and start by putting together the edges nice let's just go ahead and work on one of the edges let's go to the top the top edge and the right side right right right right okay good good I'm here this one here okay I'm really seeing a lot of top here okay so this goes like this we've got this piece that goes in here we've got this piece that goes in here we're missing one okay moving on bill unpacking still
          
          unpacking there's the piece we're looking for oh we're missing one more hey we'll get to it we'll get to it let's see if we can find that corner looks like this might be close to it there it is so now this one goes here I don't really care about that per se hey let's see let's see it could be that there's like a very small chunk missing from here oh I'm not really gonna keep my hopes up too much that's not quite there yet this is it good then this one goes like this then this one goes right here
          
          then are we ready for the other corner we are nice hey then this one goes not quite up there quite here yet okay this one it fits nice we're missing one piece on the left side now okay click-click nice we're still missing the top edge either that or I'm completely blind to it oh there it is nice okay now we can fill in the center this guy goes here moody and brooding pastor okay interesting these look like the feet of this guy got a lady got this we've got this looks like yes that nice okay this goes here
          
          these are his feet these are his feet boom so we've got this guy we've got the priest and the woman and those are the three people who went to the 13th floor or know who were there when somebody hit the button 413 okay everybody this is who we're looking bring them in okay cool [Music] Jennifer we're track we've tracked down the people in the picture one guy we brought them in we have them in the interrogation rooms tab we have a sales specialist working in the building a priest that runs the Humanitas charity
          
          and their assistant Protege the case files are ready and let's go okay here we go incident narrative the liberation fronts plot was larger than we anticipated involving simultaneous bombing operations across the city to put despite our best efforts we were unable to track down all of them in time one of the explosions happened in a large downtown office building close to the end of working hours although the casualty reports are still being compiled estimates hint at dozens of dead missing and wounded our explosion
          
          explosive forensic team claims a shortwave radio signal was used to detonate the bomb and that it was expertly placed on the 13th floor of the building the floor was being renovated from the past few months and was empty at the time of the explosion unfortunately due to the construction work the CCTV system on the floor was not operational very convenient by sifting through the recordings of the elevator cameras we managed to identify three people who briefly stayed on the 13th floor on the day of the explosion these people are
          
          currently our strongest leads and may provide further insights they have voluntarily consented to be questioned all three huh verse number one Maya Clarke aged thirty Maya Clarke is an employee of goro shioma Inc an electronics retailer that rented the three floors below the one where the explosive was placed why are you up there she has no criminal record and her performance reports show she is a hard-working committed employee while we cannot establish a motive at this time Clarke had free access to building an
          
          ample opportunity to set up the explosives at the very least she might provide useful information about co-workers the other people in the elevator or about the events during that day opening up new leads hmm okay Alex Novak age 31 we have not been able to dig much up about Novak's past he has had several name changes throughout the years and his most recent medical records state he is suspected of suffering from a form of schizophrenia for the past year Alex Novak has been receiving care and medication for
          
          Humanitas a charity founded by gabriel adams his mental instability makes him a possible suspect and his association with the adams with V Adams with Adams might have allowed him access to the 13th floor speaking of Gabriel Adams age 38 a well-known and respected local priest Gabriel Adams has been breached preaching in the city for the last let's say two years more recently he has found Humanitas a chair a Christian charity focused on helping people with disabilities or special needs and reintegrating them into society
          
          Humanitas has had great success and has received donations and funding from several high-profile philanthropists incidentally the 13th floor is where the future headquarters of the expanding charity would have been located Adams had unrestricted access to the building so he cannot be ruled out from the suspect list hmm well hopefully we're not timed but I think this is the guy not necessarily the guy who planted the bomb but he's probably our best way in because he's not gonna dime out the organization right but him maybe we'll
          
          see okay let's get it started oh nice we don't have time that's perfect rough indication of how relaxed your subject is yeah okay well let's start with my Clark let's just get some information right hello miss Clark thank you for Green answer a few questions problem questions about what I just had a few questions about the explosions explosion and the building of the bit of course come clear very soon just answer the question sir here to prove me your nodded murderous terrorist now let's be nice over here boom it was quite the
          
          tragedy what happened I mean not not the questions okay where the video of you taking the elevator to the floor where the bomb was placed I have some questions about the explosion I'd like to talk to some other people a few personal questions sure do you live in the city where do you work I know it's in our report but still well nowhere right now I mean I used to work in the office building that blew up but like it blew up what is it that you do or did I'm in sales a sales manager used to be at
          
          least not sure where the company stands right now and what do they do wait I mean I coordinate different sales efforts I assign sales territories set quotas organize it meant to the sales team assign sales training rights sales - I guess it's similar to being a manager in any other field you were manager cause he's suspicious in any way did you spot anyone suspicious on the floor right okay any co-workers just a couple of run-of-the-mill sexual harassers but probably not terrorists I'm gonna say be
          
          run-of-the-mill that doesn't usually happen in offices I hear you HR doesn't really do anything about them does it well sales cultures invites that type I guess nope just symbolic stuff but that discernible effect or maybe something serious just if the infractions obvious half of those nasties are best buds with the boss of HR anyway okay go back anybody suspicious on the floors no I mean there was this janitor that was stealing so but they fired him that's not really helpful to enjoy your work
          
          yeah do you enjoy your work no not really I mean I don't think about it like that money's money I'm good at sales and I get to focus on my passions the rest of the time and what are your passions are they making explosives okay tolerate your job because it gives you the money to pursue your passions would you like to talk to segment to me about them for a second boom well I don't see how they're in any way relevant to the investigation I mean I I don't think there are anything special I like what
          
          everyone likes hanging out with friends traveling but a martial arts a bit of art little making homemade bombs do-do-do-do-do so you say you like hanging out with friends you like traveling any pretty destinations you enjoy concerts I am sorry for the previous conversation about your romantic situation I did not say anything about her previous romantic situation we'll come back to that you live in a city if you question about your jobs you're more about your hobbies well let's just get to it eh it's
          
          clearly place the bomb no it's not okay let's just go with talking about the explosion mm-hmm where were you when the explosion happened I was on my way home I headed for the subway must have known people affected by us how are you holding up I'm fine still processing all this but I'll be fine if at any point you feel and we're well with thinking of the people effective I suppose let me know where did you say you were here's why someone they have any witnesses bomb contained traces of peroxide at any
          
          point you feel overwhelmed just let me know I'm fine still processing all this but I'm fine you have any idea why someone would choose that specific building no it doesn't really make sense I mean there are many people in there maybe that's why do you have any witnesses who can corroborate what you said about where you were okay and you know are you familiar with these substances boom it sound like dangerous chemicals I have no idea what they do okay how about any corroboration we can get look she's getting concerned what no no
          
          I was walking alone I mean there could be some subway surveillance footage but finding that's your job not mine okay like to talk to you about some other people talk about that janitor tell me about that soap hey Shrek I'm sure but they fired him half a year ago what impression did he give you I didn't really talk to him but he we all knew he was stealing soap liquid soap I mean that's okay was he angry with getting fired I guess no one likes getting fired and they see him after he was fired well I
          
          saw him downstairs a few weeks ago talking with some guys old co-worker friends I think interesting was there anyone else on a 13th floor with you nobody I knew just some priest and some guy looking around alright let's talk about that priest sure what about him what impression did he give you he seemed nice I mean dignified at all that he had a nice voice to start and soothing did you talk about anything not really I mean other than he talked some gave me a little speech about how smoking kills you really okay did he
          
          also stop on the 13th yeah we all did I mean we didn't plan on it it just happened really let's talk about that guy sure whatever you say what impression did he give you he seemed really sad he looked at that priest all the time like a puppy would you talk to him not not really I just caught him telling the priest I hope they like me or something like that broke my heart for all of five seconds and that he stopped on 13 yeah I told you he did he stopped there with the priest buddy okay while the people I assume that ended it
          
          you to do listen I got video of you on on the floor huh I said the terrorists weren't targeting our company specifically oh oh you mean a 13th floor all over the bomb was played okay because of this you're one of our main suspects because you were there we hope you could help us understand what happened to others yeah since you were there BAM opening up nice well I didn't see much I mean there wasn't much to see you know okay but do you know about the Liberation Front claimed the attack yes do you know what they stand for stand
          
          for like anti-establishment right and for personal freedom well if it includes the freedom blow things up then no no not too noble okay what do you think about the ideals of the front house like excuses to do evil for me how do you feel about them doing things that this like this bombing here in the city angry scared and where you first work with the Liberation Front and she didn't do it I'm just kind of curious what the heck no they never approached me I didn't like I didn't think did they what I mean
          
          force people into it okay fine did it okay let's go talk to some other people huh hello mr. Novak thank you for a green answer a few questions you're welcome all right thanks man if you cooperate you'll be out of here in no time I think your input will be very useful oh beautopia scry see pants will be here for a while no no we got to here in no time we all do our time one day at a time okay questions for you Alex we have a video of you taking the bomb or take the elevator the floor where the bomb
          
          happened okay it's a questions for you that I'm the best guy to ask are you employed I'm on medical leave off sir I'll be back to work soon should we notify any family that you're here no no no need for that I I know my way home what do friends call you Alex 'red Novak they used to call me Bob but I don't go by that anymore so what should I call you alex is fine or Novak or a combination in any order really I'd like to ask you some questions about your condition then or now well let's talk about then I guess then it's important
          
          to talk about even if it hurts well when did it start manifesting I first heard the birds when I was 12 the woman came later when I was 18 what the birds what were they they're not anymore for the most part well who the birds were no they weren't somebody just some birds blue and black but I'm not an ornithologist and the woman what she she went away for good yeah but who was she I never did either but if you want I can describe her to for you yeah please describe her two legs two arms two eyes two ears one of everything
          
          else that old her hair color changed okay and what symptoms did you have they talked and I listened to too much they were very distracting I couldn't focus hey how'd you live with your condition I kept breathing I focused on that and eating that was important too and how did you deal with it I didn't father Gabriel's charity dealt with it okay right now I'm more interested in out the now is all because of father Gabriel's charity it wouldn't be the now if it is without that do you do advertisers for the capables charity
          
          um yeah I do interviews and photo shoots and stuff like that all the time it's exhausting work I have to say okay so you enrolled into Humanitas program no father Gabriel enrolled me i I didn't see the point but he insisted what sort of treatment did you get coordinated specialty care could you elaborate on that it means that someone talks to you then someone else gives you the pills and someone else is your friend [Music] interesting did the symptoms ameliorate or disappear completely it made everything quieter and quieter safe okis
          
          it's good hey and how long were you under this treatment it never stops I'm in my second year now and as a religion the main focus it's like my priest what do you think religion and crazy people go wrong do they try to convert people does it have a religious agenda are you religious Alex we've got enough to worry about in this life without worrying about the next one you know okay do they try to convert people I mean they're not shoving Bibles down people's throats if that's what you mean but but it is led
          
          by a priest so they try to convert people but I already said they don't do it more than you would expect does it have a religious agenda it's just the usual agenda with calendars and stuff there were sermons from time to time this I'm getting seriously do I have to know yourself hell you talking about no okay let's go back let's try it let's try and see if we could be nice and if not we will push him to breaking point I guess hey sure you wouldn't want us to notify families when I like to talk nice Christian my
          
          conditions go back I got the explosion huh actually no I'm sorry it's how the universe began oh no now that one yeah sure ask okay no let's talk about the other people real quick let's talk about the other people in the elevator questioning people few questions about people you really are a people's perfect person I am was there anyone else on the 13th floor and on the shrug there could have been hundreds of people there I didn't see any though only if there's anyone on there I said there could have been hundreds of people
          
          I didn't see any though okay fine I have some questions about father or about that woman let's talk about the woman was there a smoking woman yeah father Gabriel gave her the your body is your temple servant okay have some questions about that woman you know III don't think it was legal that she was smoking indoors what impression did she leave behind I don't like smokers well no one does really I guess did you talk to her on the elevator or on the on the floor no I I'm sure that I made sure to look if her
          
          mouth was moving okay what did she do on the 13th floor he just sat somewhere and polluted the place with her stupid smoke what wait so she actually went up to the 13th floor weird okay so let's talk about father Gabriel yes what about him who were you referring to when you were telling the priest you hope people like you yeah we were going to meet some people in nice suits and ask them for money okay on a 13th floor which is empty though what's your opinion of him if he ain't an angel God sure should
          
          hire him ASAP he's a really nice dude okay did you talk to him in the elevator yeah he said he was doing God's work through his new headquarters for Humanitas we wanted to open well it was longer than that but but that was the gist of it what did he do on a 13th floor he said he had to inspect the refurbished process so he went around you know inspecting okay we've gone through that fine let's talk about the explosion it went high in the air saw it from afar but please ask where were you when it
          
          happened in the car I think we um we heard about it on the on the radio I think you heard about the explosion on the radio and that you saw it from afar which one is it well both I saw from a distance and I also heard about it on the radio aha so after all where were you in the car I'm sure now well as sure as one can be do you know why anyone might have chosen that specific building because the poor structural design awfully specific Alex you think about the structural design a lot you know how to how do you know I'd
          
          had poor structural design that's what the architect said when he was talking to father Gabriel about redoing the floor for Humanitas do you think about it a lot yeah I've been thinking about that since the explosion makes sense doesn't it you're onto something with who might be part of this conspiracy it was just an act of random violence oh this is like a way to go down his whole schizophrenia thing maybe yeah who could be a part of that man they staple enthusiam and it had to be someone with access motive and possibly
          
          delusions of power someone really should get a team to investigate this I'm with you okay you know why anyone might choose that specific building I told you because of the structural thing right did anybody know you know get hurt no that they missed us this time bad coordination on their part they're not after you but if they help me I'll make sure they don't hurt anyone ever again Alex I think you're on to something we have to get to them before they get to you yeah man boom don't worry about me I'll keep my
          
          eyes open uh-huh how would anyone want why would anyone want you dead Alex it's the part I'm still trying to figure out man right why would they want father Gabriel dead yeah that makes no sense kill him and he goes to heaven so he's covered right yeah you think they're covered they're targeting you yeah they were after me he [ __ ] up their timing but not by much half an hour earlier and I'd be toast I'm with you man I think you're on to something I got to go and get them don't worry about me I'll keep my eyes
          
          open that's right no I'm contained that stuff do you know anything about it that's a string of nice words sounds like the sort of thing you should ask a hardware shop about though okay back now we have a video of you up there I'm glad the drones are still working what no there were cameras in the elevator and we have pictures we've been you've been on our radar for quite some time you're in big trouble Alex relax I just need your help on understand what went on here oh yeah oh yeah you've been on our radar man you won't get me a lot
          
          I didn't do anything though yeah why'd you stop on a 13th floor man the elevators stopped there because that's the button father Gabriel pressed elevators are cool is there anyone else on that floor there was this woman she was smoking sitting on a pile of concrete sacks already up there you see anything out of the ordinary on that floor I try not to see extraordinary things really were you within the elevator father Gabriel of course and a woman I don't know her name I'm sorry I should have asked what did you do while you
          
          were on that floor I looked around I played with some small concrete pieces on the floor for a bit not much honestly really some questions about you the 13th floor some questions about the explosion instrumental some other people I assume by this point you know about the Liberation Front no who's that up with the [ __ ] you know who they are stop awaiting the topic they're the people who put a bomb what terrorist I need to be brought to justice the people who put up the bomb Alex Oh Oh them I know them right do you
          
          know what they stand for what do you think about the ideals how do you feel what their aggressive means neither they stand for I think they do most of their work sitting down ha ha ha where's the freedom personal freedom man I too wish to be free to be a bit allowed to be what I want to be on the basis of wanting to be that which I am to be he is super open who I should probably just ask him a question huh do you think my ideals they are fighting for I didn't feel about their aggressive agenda I mean I really don't want to
          
          think about that screw that huh he's getting really concerned now were you forced to work with the Liberation Front they don't have the kind of kill kilonewtons needed to make me work with them really we've done something you've done nothing but evade my questions it's clear you have something to hide boom emotions are the devil's gateway lock them up chain them and you chain your demons Alex low third-person talking and he's got that got the crazy eye thing going on don't make me pull out the answers by force it's time for some
          
          brutal honesty I will sit here all sit here all night and question every [ __ ] personality but I have to and feel you have answers Alex answers that can save lives and can prevent tragedies like that explosion the nanobots have reached your brain by this point you have no choice but to comply yeah nanobots man shake their head clutching their slouching as the demeanor changes we're both the recipients and the generators of guilt the cycle cannot be broken yeah it's clear you're planted the bomb Alex and so the truth bombs
          
          explode and the officer misses them entirely for the fifth eyes closed oh yeah let's talk about Gabriel Adams hey Gabriel hello mr. Adams thanks for agreeing to ask I mean he's definitely the guy we have to ask but I'm assuming I get something from him to maybe get him to crack a little bit more please call me Father Gabriel or just Gabriel how can I help you I tell me why you murdered hundreds of people placing bombs it's a few questions that help us clarify some amounts of this bombing situation
          
          nothing too hard you can help by cooperating fully and it's very truthfully what terrible tragedy that was oh he's getting concerned I'll do everything I can God forgive those souls I don't trust you priest man not at all give me a few more personal questions I understand you're the leader of the charity I'm glad you've heard of us the support we've received has been a blessing yeah well see how good yeah actually is when we will add someone's trying to make this mess a city better who better to lead charitable effort the priest um
          
          that's somebody's trying to clean up this town I assure you it's a labor of love done in his name do you think it's morally right to drag Alex from Interview degree just to boost your donations he's an example of the good we are doing and the faithless needs such examples I'm afraid huh what does it chair you do but we try to help those stuck by misfortune and put them on a path for self-improvement I understand from Alex that you'd do something called coordinated specialty cares that treatment unique to him no it's actually
          
          a common recovery therapy for those with psychosis the type of help do you usually offer to your disaffected what's the vulnerable groups to target so accordionist as a standard psychotic treatment from what I understand from the psychologists working with us how did you get hooked up with Alex well it is actually a funny story we were doing an outreach effort into a poor neighborhood effectively a large and free buffet Alex came to us with a boot in a pot saying that he also wanted to help his warm soul fought his inner
          
          demons even then before receiving any support when you say Alexson what type of help do you usually offer well anything that they might require we have a very case-by-case approach where we try to truly help each individual rather than having ineffective programs that target the masses without actually making any meaningful change as any good pastor does to his flock and what flawl nerville groups do you target all sorts are equals in God's eye we help every one that needs help and yes people like
          
          Alex do require our help but sadly so few also accepted as your role in the charity I'm the chairman main spokesman I do my best to promote the charities value to the outside world and where your main donors our donations are anonymous so I'm sure you understand I'm sorry it's fine let's talk about the other people in the elevator if I know them I'll do my best to answer was there anyone else on the 13th floor with you know the workers were not there that day Alex was with me oh and there was this
          
          woman there smoking in the lobby well let's talk about this woman I doubt she had anything to do with any of this really what did she do on the 13th floor she sat on a box in the lobby and smoked a cigarette horizon to those Satan windows that smartphones are uh huh instead Unabomber over here hates technology why did you try to convince her to stop smoking well smoking destroys our bodies I think it's as simple as that I usually try to eat lost souls and what was her impression she just seemed bored with
          
          her job officer or tired by it sneaking away to smoke on an empty floor so juvenile aside Alex he's such a special boy and he has come so far I was Alex with you he usually helps me with fundraising and we had just finished a meeting just finished Alex looks geo some sort of st. are you comfortable with this you must understand Alex is not like other people he doesn't use language quite like a normal person would what did he do on a 13th floor I don't think he did anything he just waited for me in the lobby did
          
          he say anything suspicious while you were in the elevator who Alex I agree he does sometimes say strange things but that cannot be held against him what's your impression of him after the time you spent together officer if you could imagine but a fraction of what he's been through you would admire him as much as I do okay let's talk about the explosion real quick I'm afraid I wasn't anywhere near when it happened so I know very little and where were you I was in my car with Alex someone called to tell me about the
          
          tragedy uh-huh Alex said the news came on the radio Diddy oh yes that's right liar liar Mick liar Steen over here where did you say you were when the explosion that anyone know you know so alex is the architect told you the building had pores that's why I was chosen I'm fin traded okay fine did anyone you know get hurt I have previously met with some executives that worked there I pray they are safe alex says that the architect told you that the building was unstable it's not for us to question why these terrible
          
          tragedies and tragedies happen God will smite those whose wickedness harms innocent souls aha and the bomb contained traces of this stuff are you familiar with it I'm afraid I haven't I am no I have no chemist perhaps they were used by those renovating the floor haha he's getting concerned now go talk to something else here boom I got a video of you up there the bomb was in our future headquarters but would target to charity get in there Emmons places use one of the main suspects on the bombing you see why we
          
          think you would be help would be invaluable look it's time for me to receive a confession a priest yeah your main suspect so let's do this cooperation boom I am him stand officer I'll do my best to put your suspicions to rest so you can focus your resources where it matters why did you stop on the 13th floor I was there to inspect if the renovations were on schedule there were a few delays in the past is there anyone else on that floor no the workers doing the refurbishing were not there that day did you see
          
          anything out of the ordinary on that floor I'm sorry but no I spotted nothing unusual who were you with in the elevator Alex was with me and a woman she probably worked in the building what'd you do all on that floor I assessed the status of the renovation for a future office officer I wasn't there for very long there was little to look at he's getting real concerned I assume by now you know about the Liberation Front they're only redeeming quality as their conviction so sad it is so misplaced what's your opinion how do
          
          you feel about their aggressive were you forced to work do you think they stand for politics says I understand it well they stand for personal freedom what do you think of that personal freedom is important to reach one's full potential but people today are using freedom as an excuse to wrong themselves with that moral consequence okay what's your opinion on their principles I think they sound good on paper but I don't think they even bother with a paper they wrote them on and how do you feel about the
          
          aggressive means of pushing their agenda it shows conviction a rare trait nowadays if only they understood that you can only reach people's hearts through words were you forced to work with them boom no I was never contacted even so my convictions are immune immutable to such pressures it really if you had anything to do with the bombing you need to tell me now confession absolve the soul as you know go back here so the truth bomb explode talk about the explosion the walls have ice we have to rip the matter in order to be

          yourself before thinking about other people okay about you you about the Liberation Front real quick even the devil unknowingly does God's work what do you think the ideals they're fighting for many strong independent voices each demanding attention but they all want something new how do you feel about their aggressive means of pushing their agenda I think if you believe in something something good you should do everything for it so should you even hurt people no no but you have to fight the good fight and
          
          evil doers will get in your way and try to stop you do you think what they want is good father Gabriel says the flood was good because it came from God the new flood will be his will as well uh-huh you sent sympathetic to the cause you'll member you are not yet ready to become a full member of the Humanitas Alex not yet now that you think about the ideals answers do you feel but their grass means I think it's believed good ok so we already went through this clearly plant the bomb Alex and so the

          have been busy should I ask Alex about any other ends he's done for you don't stress the poor boy he he does a lot for Humanitas you understand better if you don't push him too hard anima necessary part of any club why do you need measurements no I I just do it in my spare time I very rarely get the chance these days and why do you need it it's a composite for making fuel for planes it's commercially available of course I'll get more about Alex buying nitromethane very anything here hey buddy did you choose to do - to do what

          on Liberation Front your opinion of their principles I think they sound good on paper okay fine fine let's give it a shot Gabriel if you had anything to do with this bombing you need to tell me now confession absolves the soul as you know officer please do not jump to rash conclusions do you accuse terrorism do you accuse of terrorism any individual who purchases flammable materials and as the misfortune of being in your presence I'm a man of God I have dedicated my life to saving people how could you
          
          think I would be capable of such an act one more time once I put enough I jump to Rascals but he's at nine so we're there I still don't understand what this has to do why'd you send him to pick it up I don't I told you to remember that it was Ben I must have been busy and should I ask don't stress the bore better if you don't push him too hard okay there's something I'm still missing here go back to you doo doo doo doo doo doo doo it's now graveyard for those yeah okay it's gotta be here you also have eyes we
          
          gotta rip them out let's go home anyone I left peace we who died there hey where did you get all these ideas from father Gabriel told me I could choose yeah no I got that we don't meet others by coincidence right man should give you three gallons make sure it says nitromethane yeah I think we've actually exhausted everything about this evenly down there's God's work you're trying to been avoiding each demanding attention and they all want something new hey do you know something about them I think
          
          you believe in something something good you should do everything for it and if you hurt people no know what they'll stop you if things but liberation friends doing good but is good right not yet ready to become a full member for many tests Alex not yet okay and the bombs explode and we're officers them entirely for their fifth eye is closed okay and I'll be happy to answer them where you're from how long have you been preaching any family what's your view on a religion father Alex tells me believe
          
          they were about to face a new biblical flood look around and how things are going what do you think I don't believe in God I believe things are better today than they were I believe you're right we're burning our bridges he's at a ten just so officer the devil is taking deep roots but do not lose hope God will extend this a helping hand give us a fresh start how do you envision this flood literally rain what makes you think God is preparing to burn the place down no of course not that's metaphorical a cataclysmic chain
          
          of events that will wipe out the entrenched corruption wherever it is followed by a process of renewal and spiritual enlightenment I think he's preparing to burn it down the signs are there it won't be long now the few chosen ones must prepare the ground for the rebirth about this new world would look like aa world where the Word of God easily reaches everyone a virtuous world of peace and love our children will build this promised land okay I can't think of more virtues which are more important than faith itself
          
          what made you turn to religion do you turn to convert they believe the world is going to end I always thought religion thing as potent was [ __ ] now let's see if this is step back only for that our souls required tending to someone in your position should know this what did you say your views on here any family we should notify but you're here I already told my wife I'll be late home tonight it's fine thank you for the thought uh-huh have you been preaching six years okay now the time flies let's see if we got one more here nope
          
          okay let's try one more time because he's out of ten now boom Drogheda do you he's guitarists how could you think I would be able to count you okay so you sorry drop it I have you on record claiming the apocalypse is coming as well as other extremist views I also have you confessing to ordering the purchase of extremely flammable materials claiming they are for a hobby that you cannot prove you have on top of all these I have evidence that you inquired particularly into the structural integrity of the building and
          
          that is only what I got from you and Alex up until now it's not the apocalypse it's a new flood another chance to get things right to do it properly this time alex has also told me about your troubling view that we are all damned and undeserving how long until I get even more out of him you planted the bomb you wanted to bring this new flood yourself confess priest it's over it's what a good Christian would do for his soul as well as for his neighbor for Alex Archangel you might think you could
          
          stop it you and winning agent of Satan but it is unavoidable our children will walk in the kingdom of God after the flood cleanses the souls of the wicked boom yeah I don't look up priest I got you Abbas can that be charged nice okay here we go a peace and stability special unit has been conducting investigations regarding the tragic terrorist attacks that took place several years several days ago we now have solid list of suspects are still tracking down possible leads now have a solid list of
          
          suspects in regards to the explosion that targeted the downtown spring offices building our team was able to determine the exact nature of the bomb as well as its precise placement and brought in for questioning arrested brought in for questioning three potential suspects identified through on-scene CCTV footage who had access to the floor were involved in the bombing and incriminating backgrounds and access to the floor the questioning has resulted in the confession and arrest of Gabriel Adams a 38 year old priest pub
          
          leader social activist priest who admitted his connections to the Liberation Front terror is group as well as to the manufacturing and placement of the explosives through an NGO he had he founded Humanitas Gabriel Adams had gained unrestricted access to the building by renting out the 13th floor where he placed the bomb he was aided in this by Alex Novak a troubled young man enrolled in Humanitas care system due to his circumstances he will not be charged but placed into a mental facility after further
          
          questioning will be charged with conspiracy will be questioned further than released that will not be charged but placed into a mental health facility that's probably right and then probably detained indefinitely because that's just the way it goes [Music] hey guys Jennifer good job us now that we have Adams and pour Novak we should get scrolling them mark I which one of us want to you want to know that have you taken over that Jennifer you take Novak more do you take Novak or D you're like a violent - you're gonna
