# Dark Mallard: The Complete Story

Drake lands at Charles de Gaulle with his handler, Sheldon Pane, a grizzled wolf who speaks in measured tones about operational parameters and acceptable losses. The mission briefing was simple enough: CIA operative Stella Morrison, a fellow duck, has been missing for eighteen days. Her last transmission crackled through the secure channel three weeks ago: "Leclerc family planning something big. Election in thirty days. Going dark to investigate." Since then, silence.

Drake's French is embarrassingly terrible. He can manage "Bonjour" and "Où est..." before his vocabulary crumbles into apologetic gestures. But Sheldon made it clear—people are going to die if they don't find Stella. What Sheldon didn't mention, what Drake doesn't know, is why the agency specifically recruited ducks for this kind of work. In the classified archives, filed under myths and legends, there are whispered stories of the Dark Mallard—a duck operative from decades past who could accomplish what even the wolves couldn't. The agency has been searching for another like him ever since.

The three meters that will determine Drake's fate flicker on his phone like vital signs: Cover Integrity measures whether people think he's CIA; Network Trust tracks what the community says about him; Handler Confidence reflects whether Sheldon trusts his judgment. Drop any below thirty percent and critical paths close. Drop two below fifty percent and extraction becomes mandatory. Drake doesn't realize it yet, but these metrics are also measuring something else—how close he's coming to awakening whatever dormant potential the agency believes lies within him.

## Week One: A Duck Out of Water

The concierge at Stella's apartment building knows something—Drake can see it in the way the man's shoulders tense when he mentions her name. "Bonjour monsieur. Je cherche une amie... Stella." The words come out clumsy, unpracticed. The concierge responds in rapid French, far too fast, and Drake catches only fragments: "police" and "questions" floating in a sea of incomprehension.

In this moment of crisis, Drake discovers he has instincts he didn't know he possessed. The Echo Method emerges naturally—he repeats the key words back with rising intonation: "Police? Questions?" Something in his tone, some subtle shift in posture, makes the concierge slow down and explain more carefully. Drake learns that police searched Stella's apartment, that someone official is looking for her too. As he walks away, a strange sensation washes over him—a brief flash of standing in another doorway, asking different questions in a different language, but with the same calculated patience. The memory vanishes before he can grasp it.

Three days later, at the market in Belleville, Chen the vendor selling apples greets his attempt at basic Pimsleur French with nervous kindness. "Combien pour les pommes?" works well enough, but when Drake asks about Stella, Chen's demeanor transforms. She speaks in rapid French mixed with Mandarin, and Drake catches "dangereuse" and "hommes." She's trying to warn him about dangerous men, but his linguistic limitations trap them both in frustrated miscommunication.

Again, instinct saves him. Word Banking—a technique he's never learned but somehow knows—kicks in. "Qui?" "Où?" "Quand?" He points to the street when she says "hommes," and she nods frantically, miming watching eyes. When he guesses "Police?" she shakes her head violently. "Non... Leclerc." The name hits Drake like a physical blow, accompanied by another flash—a briefing room he's never seen, voices discussing someone named Leclerc, but the details slip away like smoke.

If Drake threatens Chen for more information, if he lets frustration drive him to demand her papers or suggest immigration problems, the consequences ripple through the community instantly. Word spreads fast about Americans threatening immigrants, and Drake experiences something unsettling—a moment where the threats feel natural, where some darker part of his mind whispers that fear is just another tool. Network Trust drops twenty points, but more disturbing is the brief satisfaction he feels at Chen's terror before revulsion kicks in.

## The Shadow of François

François, the civil servant in the city planning office, is already nervous before Drake speaks a word. Stella had been researching construction permits, and François knows why she was asking questions. "Stella... permis de construction?" Drake's pronunciation is terrible, but his presence fills the small office with an tension that makes François's hands shake.

Drake has blackmail material—gambling debts, eighty-five percent confidence according to his pre-mission briefing. But this is a government building, and other employees might notice. The decision to use it feels like standing at the edge of a cliff. When Drake does apply pressure, mentioning the debts just quietly enough to be heard, François breaks completely. He gives everything: meeting locations, names, schedules. But his colleague witnesses the distress, the way François shrinks into himself.

Three days later, François is found dead in his apartment. Suicide, the local news reports. The community gossip spreads: another foreigner causing problems for French people. When Drake hears the news, he experiences his most vivid flashback yet—standing over a different body, in a different city, feeling that same terrible mixture of operational success and human cost. For a moment, he remembers other names, other faces he's destroyed for intelligence. Then the memory fades, leaving only nausea and the growing certainty that he's done this before.

Sheldon's disappointment cuts deep: "We destroyed a civilian. This isn't who we are." But Drake wonders if maybe it is who he is, if some part of him was always capable of this kind of ruthless efficiency. Handler Confidence drops twenty points, Network Trust falls fifteen, Cover Integrity slips ten. The meters aren't just measuring operational security anymore—they're tracking his transformation into something darker.

## The Countdown Begins

When Sheldon intercepts chatter about a Leclerc meeting at Café République—"Stella mentioned in connection to 'the American problem'"—Drake has three hours to convince the café owner to let him eavesdrop on the back room meeting. His Network Trust sits at a dangerous thirty-five percent after the François incident. The café owner has heard about him.

Time pressure transforms Drake. With two hours remaining, he learns the owner owes money to Leclerc's people. With one hour left, he must choose: build trust through vulnerability by sharing his own fears about Stella, or leverage the debt as a threat. The vocabulary he learns depends on his choice—command phrases for crisis authority or request phrases for building rapport. Either way, the overheard intelligence reveals that Stella is alive, held in a warehouse in Ivry, and that "the American knows too much. Deal with her before election day."

The irony isn't lost on Drake: the American who "knows too much" might be the American who doesn't know anything at all—not about the Dark Mallard legend, not about why ducks were recruited, not about what sleeping capabilities the agency believes he possesses.

## Week Two: The Consequences Cascade

By day ten, Drake's methods have created a diplomatic incident. The Station Chief, another wolf with tired eyes and expensive suits, calls him in: "Your methods are creating problems. The French are asking questions about aggressive American 'tourists' in Belleville." The afternoon brings a call from his police contact: "Whatever you're doing, stop. An American is threatening civilians in my district. I can't protect you anymore." By evening, Chen won't sell to him, and other vendors watch with suspicious eyes.

Ahmed the butcher represents Drake's last chance at local intelligence. The man knows about Leclerc's protection racket, but he's heard about Drake too. If Network Trust sits above fifty percent, Ahmed says, "Chen says you fight the bad men. How can I help?" Below thirty percent: "You're the American who destroys people. Get out."

Ahmed has critical intelligence—Stella's exact location—but won't share if Drake's reputation is blown. When rapid street French mixed with Arabic defeats Drake's comprehension, he employs Sympathy Intel: "Stella... mon amie... inquiet." Something in how he says "worried" changes Ahmed's entire demeanor from suspicious to protective. Topic Steering keeps the conversation focused on concepts Drake knows: "Stella, femme, danger, Leclerc." Ahmed's tension spikes when Drake mentions "warehouse," and suddenly Drake knows to investigate that thread further.

If Network Trust drops below thirty percent, the community turns fully hostile. Graffiti appears: "Americans go home." His photo circulates in WhatsApp groups. Hostile teens follow him through the streets. Vendors close their stalls when they see him coming. Sheldon delivers the final warning: "Community is turning against CIA presence. We're pulling you out." The choice becomes extract safely or go rogue to find Stella.

## Week Three: The Dark Mallard Awakens

The warehouse infiltration splits along two paths based on Drake's reputation. If the community has turned against him, he goes alone—no backup, no local support, just whatever capabilities he can summon from the growing darkness inside him. When the guard challenges him—"Qu'est-ce que vous faites ici?"—his vocabulary fails completely. "Je... uhh... médecin?" His pronunciation is so obviously foreign that cover blows instantly. Alarms blare, and Drake fights through three guards with a violence that surprises him, moves he's never trained but somehow knows.

If the community supports him, Ahmed's cousin works security and the resistance creates distractions. The guard recognizes him: "Vous êtes l'ami américain?" Drake nods, and learns "Stella est au sous-sol." Clean extraction with community support feels like redemption, like proof he can be something other than the Dark Mallard.

When Drake finds Stella—alive but traumatized—she delivers the crucial intelligence: "Leclerc's planning false flag bombing. Voting stations across Paris. Creates chaos, brother becomes president promising order." Three days to stop coordinated attacks across the city. The final countdown mission will determine not just Paris's fate, but Drake's understanding of who he really is.

The mission approach splits into two tracks. The Assertive Track means storming Leclerc compounds, demanding answers through authority and threats. Drake learns command phrases, intimidation vocabulary, the language of power and fear. Intelligence comes quickly but exposure is massive. The Diplomatic Track works through community contacts, building evidence cases through relationship language and cultural sensitivity. It's slower but sustainable, offering community protection during operations.

Drake's reputation determines which options remain available. High trust provides safe houses, coordinated intelligence, protection during operations. Low trust means solo operations in hostile environments with high casualty risks and no local support.

## The Legend Revealed

In the final confrontation, as Drake pieces together the bombing plot and tracks down the Leclerc operation, Sheldon reveals what the agency has hidden from him. The Dark Mallard wasn't just a legend—he was real, a duck operative whose methods were so effective and so ruthless that the wolves couldn't replicate them. The agency started recruiting ducks specifically to find another like him. Every blackmail decision, every moment of calculated brutality, every time Drake accessed knowledge he shouldn't possess, the agency was watching, measuring, hoping.

"We didn't recruit you randomly, Drake," Sheldon says during the final briefing. "We recruited you because we believe you might be him—reincarnated, cloned, or psychically connected to the original Dark Mallard. Every mission has been a test."

The flashbacks suddenly make sense—not memories of his own past, but echoes of the original Dark Mallard's operations. The instincts, the techniques he knows without learning, the growing comfort with moral compromise—all signs that the legend lives within him.

## The Dark Ending Spectrum

The best case scenario sees the bombing prevented through community intelligence networks, Leclerc arrested by French authorities, and Stella recovered alive. Drake's operation becomes CIA training standard, proof that relationships matter more than coercion. Sheldon says, "This is how intelligence work should be done. Relationships, not coercion." But Drake wonders if he's failed some essential test, if the agency wanted him to become the Dark Mallard and he chose humanity instead.

The compromise case prevents the bombing but with civilian casualties. Some of Leclerc's network escapes, Stella survives but traumatized, and Drake's methods work at moral cost. "Mission accomplished," Sheldon says, "but we became something we don't recognize." Drake feels the Dark Mallard stirring within him, satisfied with operational success despite human cost.

The failure case sees the bombing partially successful with mass casualties. Leclerc's brother wins the emergency election, Stella is found dead, and Drake's blown operation compromises future CIA work in France. "We saved no one and destroyed everything we touched," Sheldon says. Drake realizes he was never meant to save everyone—he was meant to become the weapon that could stop threats like this permanently.

The darkest truth emerges when Drake has become addicted to blackmail, when he's used fear to control people so often that even success feels like defeat. He's become like Leclerc—a threat to the very people he was sent to protect. When surviving civilians who helped him express their terror of what he's become, Drake understands that the Dark Mallard wasn't a hero in the archives. He was a cautionary tale, and Drake has become the sequel.

In the final conversation system demonstration, every technique Drake has learned serves dual purposes. The Echo Method that helped him understand Chen's warnings also taught him to manipulate responses. Word Banking for intelligence extraction works equally well for intimidation. Emotional Mirror that opened François's heart also broke his spirit. The Phone Dilemma—using translation apps during intimate conversations—represents the fundamental choice between authentic connection and expedient efficiency.

The stakes have always been larger than finding Stella or stopping Leclerc. Every conversation skill Drake develops reduces his dependence on blackmail, but every cultural understanding he gains also teaches him which pressure points cause maximum damage. Every vocabulary word he masters naturally means one less situation where he needs to threaten civilians, but also one more tool for psychological manipulation.

The darkness isn't in the villains—it's in the choice between becoming effective through patience and respect, or becoming a threat through expedient brutality. Leclerc wins not by defeating Drake, but by forcing him to become the kind of person who can't function in the environment he's supposed to protect. French isn't just language learning—it's moral education wrapped in operational necessity.

Drake's transformation into the Dark Mallard represents every player's journey from reluctant operative to efficient weapon. Like the reputation cascade in other systems, each brutal choice makes the next one easier, until operational effectiveness becomes indistinguishable from the evil being fought. The legend the agency sought to resurrect was never about heroism—it was about the terrible efficiency of an operative willing to sacrifice anything, including himself, for mission success.

The Dark Mallard doesn't emerge from training or intention. He emerges from necessity, from moments when the clock is ticking and innocent lives hang in the balance and the only tool that works is fear. Drake learns that the original Dark Mallard probably started just like him—a duck who wanted to save people and discovered that sometimes saving people requires destroying others.

Your choice determines not just the mission outcome, but which Drake emerges from the shadows of Paris: the operative who proved ducks could be heroes, or the one who proved the Dark Mallard was never really a legend at all.
