# Interrogation: You Will Be Deceived - Mechanics Explained

## Important Note on Numbers

The specific numerical values (+5, -15, etc.) in the diagrams were **extrapolated from gameplay descriptions**, not explicitly stated in the game documentation. The actual game likely uses similar mechanics but may have different values. This document separates confirmed mechanics from inferred details.

## Core Game Loop

### 1. Interrogation Phase

You interrogate suspects using four main strategies:

#### **Empathy** (Confirmed Mechanics)

- Increases Openness meter
- More effective if suspect shares your ideology
- Character trait bonuses apply (e.g., Pacifist gets empathy bonus)
- Unlocks personal/trust-based dialogue options

#### **Fear/Intimidation** (Confirmed Mechanics)

- Increases Fear meter
- Decreases Openness meter
- More effective on "weak" suspects
- Can cause suspect to shut down if overused
- Unlocks nervous/breakdown dialogue options

#### **Manipulation** (Confirmed Mechanics)

- Affects both meters unpredictably
- Can backfire and reverse progress
- Requires intel from missions to be effective
- High risk, high reward strategy

#### **Enhanced Interrogation/Torture** (Confirmed Mechanics)

- Massively increases Fear meter
- Major negative impact on all reputation meters
- Decreases team morale
- Increases your mental instability
- Risk of making suspect unconscious (fail state)
- Not available if you have Pacifist trait
- Not available in some episodes (e.g., Episode 10)

### 2. Meter Thresholds (Confirmed)

Both Fear and Openness meters have thresholds that unlock new dialogue options:

- Low threshold: Basic information/reactions
- Medium threshold: More cooperation/breakdown
- High threshold: Full truth/complete breakdown
- 100% Fear: Suspect shuts down completely (bad)
- 100% Openness: Full cooperation achieved (good)

### 3. Team Management Phase (Between Episodes)

**Budget Allocation** (Your version may start with $3000 instead of $1000):

- **Team Morale**: Pay bonuses to keep Jen, Tab, and Mordechai happy
- **Intel Missions**: Send team to gather information
- **Public Relations**: Manage your public image

**Team Interactions** (Confirmed):

- You talk with team members before budget allocation
- Their morale affects mission success rates
- Low morale = higher chance of mission failure
- High morale across all team = achievement

### 4. Reputation Systems (Confirmed)

Three separate reputation meters:

- **Public Opinion**: How citizens view you
- **Press Relations**: Media coverage of your actions  
- **Authority/Boss Approval**: Government satisfaction

**Consequences**:

- Any reputation below 25% creates danger
- Low public opinion = assassination risk
- Low authority approval = firing risk
- Low press relations = scandal risks

### 5. Hidden Tracking Systems

#### **Ideology Points** (Confirmed Concept, Inferred Mechanics)

The game tracks your ideological leanings:

- **Left-wing**: Accumulated through empathetic choices, protecting civil rights
- **Liberal**: Balanced approaches, due process
- **Right-wing**: Authority-focused, harsh methods

**What affects ideology**:

- Dialogue choices that align with political views
- Using enhanced interrogation (right-wing)
- Showing mercy/understanding (left-wing)
- Following proper procedures (liberal)

#### **Mental Instability** (Confirmed)

- Increases with extreme actions
- Enhanced interrogation adds to instability
- High instability unlocks special dialogue
- 100% instability = achievement
- Required for "Execute All" ending with Messiah trait

#### **Restart Counter** (Confirmed)

- Tracks how many times you restart episodes
- 10+ restarts = achievement
- Too many restarts + low reputation = game over

## Episode-Specific Rules

### Episodes with Timers (Confirmed)

- Episode 2: 7-minute timer
- Episode 3: Bomb countdown
- Episode 5: Hostage crisis timer
- Episode 7: Time pressure

### Special Episodes (Confirmed)

- Episode 1: Tutorial, no timer
- Episode 8: YOU are interrogated (can fail permanently)
- Episode 9: Must choose 2 of 4 suspects
- Episode 10: Final episode, no enhanced methods allowed

## Endings (Confirmed Options)

Five possible endings based on accumulated ideology points:

1. **Justice For All** (Default): Balanced approach
2. **Release Anaba** (Left-wing): High left-wing points
3. **Release Damascus** (Liberal): High liberal points  
4. **Release Bennett** (Right-wing): High right-wing points
5. **Execute All** (Special): Requires Messiah trait + 100% instability

## Key Strategic Considerations

### Mission Intel Loop

1. Keep team morale high → Better mission success
2. Successful missions → Bonus dialogue options
3. More options → Easier interrogations
4. Failed missions → No bonuses, harder interrogations

### Reputation Balancing

- Enhanced methods tank all reputations
- Press statements can recover public/press opinion
- Authority likes results but not scandals
- Must balance effectiveness with public image

### Ideology Management

- Your ending depends on accumulated ideology
- Every choice contributes to your political profile
- Can't change alignment late in game
- Plan your desired ending from the start

## Version Differences

You mentioned starting with $3000 budget instead of $1000. This suggests either:

- Different difficulty settings
- Updated game version
- Platform differences

The core mechanics should remain the same, but specific values may vary.
