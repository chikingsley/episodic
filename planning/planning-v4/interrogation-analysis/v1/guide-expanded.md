## Game Overview

"Interrogation: You will be deceived" is a narrative puzzle game in a noir detective setting developed by Critique Gaming and published by Mixtvision. Released on December 5, 2019, this 5-6 hour psychological thriller puts you in the role of an unnamed detective leading a special task force to dismantle a dangerous terrorist organization known as The Liberation Front.

### Key Features

- Hand-drawn black and white animations created by rotoscoping over 1000 photos of more than 40 actors
- Complex conversational puzzles with psychological manipulation mechanics
- Team and resource management between interrogations
- Multiple branching storylines with five distinct endings
- Deep exploration of moral and ethical dilemmas
- Symbolic (non-graphic) depictions of performing torture

The game has been compared to titles like "Papers, Please," "This War of Mine," and "Orwell" for its attempts to raise important moral, ideological and practical questions about contemporary issues including terrorism, police brutality, and power imbalances.

## Foreword

WARNING: THIS GUIDE CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS

This comprehensive guide is designed to help achievement hunters obtain all achievements in "Interrogation: You Will Be Deceived." I strongly recommend playing through the game at least once blind before using this guide, as knowing the outcomes and strategies will significantly impact your first-time experience.

**Important Note**: This game deals with mature themes including radical ideologies, human casualties resulting from terrorism and contains symbolic (non-graphic) depictions of performing torture. The narrative challenges players to confront difficult moral choices about the means used to achieve justice.

## Core Game Mechanics

### Interrogation System

The heart of the game revolves around psychological interrogations where you must extract information from suspects through various methods:

#### Psychological Meters

- **Heart Rate (Fear)**: Indicates how afraid or stressed the suspect is
- **Pupil Dilation (Openness)**: Shows how receptive or trusting they are toward you

These meters are crucial for determining your approach. A frightened subject may be more responsive to threats, while an open one could be convinced with sympathy.

In the tutorial with Douglas Byrd, you can see this in action. Initially, asking direct questions like 'Why do you steal bikes?' fails. But shifting to an empathetic approach ('Can't believe they have me chasing bikes') makes his pupil meter dilate, showing he's more open to talk. Later, threatening him with prison time ('You know how many months you do for a bike theft?') makes his heart rate spike, indicating fear.

#### Interrogation Techniques

1. **Empathy**: Building rapport and trust with suspects
2. **Intimidation**: Using fear and pressure to break down resistance
3. **Manipulation**: Exploiting psychological vulnerabilities
4. **Enhanced Interrogation**: Turning off the recorder to use physical methods
   1. The playthrough demonstrates that while using the taser on Byrd makes him 'terrified' and leads to a quick confession, the instructor immediately warns you about the consequences. This establishes early on that these methods, while effective for raising fear, come at a cost to your professional standing and reputation.

### Enhanced Interrogation (Torture) Mechanics

At any point in the interrogation, you can turn off the recorder and select a variety of torture options. These include:

- Getting in the suspect's face
- Slamming them against walls
- Using implements like knives or tasers
- More extreme methods unlocked through certain "memories" (traits)

**Important**: You can even overdo it, incapacitating them. In mechanical terms, it usually causes fear levels to skyrocket. However, using these methods has severe consequences:

- Damages your public reputation
- Affects team morale
- Can lead to false confessions from innocent suspects
- Impacts which endings become available
- May result in your character developing mental instability

### Team Management System

Between interrogations, you manage a team of three core investigators, each with their own skills and moral boundaries:

#### Team Mechanics

- **Motivation Levels**: Each team member has individual morale that affects mission success rates
- **Mission Assignments**: Send team members to gather intelligence, work with informants, or handle public relations
- **Budget Allocation**: Limited resources must be divided between:
  - Team development and morale
  - Information gathering missions
  - Public relations efforts
  - Emergency responses

#### Key Team Interactions

- After-work drinks to boost morale
- Consulting with experts and informants
- Managing conflicting personalities and approaches
- Balancing workload to prevent burnout

### Reputation System

Your actions affect three key reputation metrics:

1. **Public Opinion**: How citizens view your department
   - Affected by: Use of force, press statements, successful prevention of attacks
   - High reputation: Public supports your methods
   - Low reputation: Risk of assassination, protests, reduced cooperation

2. **Press Relations**: Media coverage of your activities
   - Affected by: Transparency, press conferences, leaks
   - High reputation: Favorable coverage, scandals downplayed
   - Low reputation: Negative stories, increased scrutiny

3. **Authority Approval**: Support from police hierarchy and government
   - Affected by: Case success rate, following protocol, political alignment
   - High reputation: Better resources, more freedom
   - Low reputation: Budget cuts, team demoralization, potential firing

### Memory System (Character Traits)

Throughout the game, you'll choose "memories" that define your detective's background and approach:

#### Examples of Memories

- **Pacifist**: Cannot use enhanced interrogation but gains empathy bonuses
- **Trained Ideologist**: Unlocks dialogue options about political theory
- **Statistical Expert**: Provides numerical precision for psychological meters
- **Mad Genius**: Associated with mental instability and extreme methods
- **Messiah Complex**: Believes in extrajudicial justice
- **Double Agent**: Allows unique infiltration dialogue options

These traits significantly affect available dialogue options, interrogation methods, and potential endings.

## The Liberation Front - Understanding the Factions

The Liberation Front is an implausibly slippery alliance of left, right, and libertarian partisans all at once, united in their opposition to the current system but divided in their vision for the future. Understanding these ideological divisions is crucial for successful interrogations and achieving specific endings.

### The Three Leaders (The Triumvirate)

#### 1. Anaba Lee - The Collectivist Wing

- **Ideology**: Socialist/communist ideals focused on equality and collective ownership
- **Followers**: Activists, social justice advocates, community organizers
- **Key Beliefs**: Wealth redistribution, dismantling class structures, collective decision-making
- **Interrogation Approach**: Responds to discussions about inequality, social justice, and community
- **Associated Ending**: "No Kings, No Destinies"

#### 2. Damascus Reed - The Individualist Wing

- **Ideology**: Libertarian/anarcho-capitalist focused on personal freedom and minimal government
- **Followers**: Entrepreneurs, tech libertarians, free-market advocates
- **Key Beliefs**: Stateless society, private property rights, individual sovereignty
- **Interrogation Approach**: Responds to discussions about freedom, markets, and individual rights
- **Associated Ending**: "Never Tread On Me"

#### 3. Colonel James Bennett - The Authoritarian Wing

- **Ideology**: Right-wing authoritarianism focused on order and traditional hierarchy
- **Followers**: Military personnel, traditionalists, those seeking strong leadership
- **Key Beliefs**: Social cleansing, restoration of order, elimination of perceived degeneracy
- **Interrogation Approach**: Responds to discussions about strength, order, and tradition
- **Associated Ending**: "Evolve Or Die"

### Faction Dynamics

- Bennett and Lee are ideological opposites and despise each other
- Reed occupies a middle ground but has personal connections with both
- Damascus had "amazing sex in Saigon" with Anaba - a detail that can be exploited
- Each leader can be manipulated to betray the others by exploiting ideological differences

## Tips and Strategies

### General Gameplay Tips

1. **Understanding Cause and Effect**:
   - Every action has consequences - interrogations, interviews, press releases, and team management all affect your endings
   - The game tracks your ideological leanings through all choices, not just major decisions
   - Small dialogue choices accumulate to determine available options later

2. **Interrogation Strategies**:
   - Study suspect backgrounds carefully - they contain clues about psychological vulnerabilities
   - Balance fear and openness - too much of either can shut down conversations
   - Failed interrogations often provide information for successful retries
   - Some suspects require specific knowledge gained from missions or previous interrogations

3. **Managing Multiple Meters**:
   - It's nearly impossible to maintain perfect ratings across all categories
   - Decide early which reputation aspects matter for your playthrough
   - Team morale affects mission success rates significantly
   - Budget allocation has long-term consequences

4. **Efficient Achievement Hunting**:
   - **First Playthrough**: Complete on Challenge Mode for all episode achievements
   - **Second Playthrough**: Focus on specific endings and missed achievements
   - **Episode 2**: Use for quickly obtaining failure-related achievements
   - **Save Management**: Save before Episodes 9-10 to explore different endings

### Ending-Specific Strategies

#### For Faction Endings (Anaba/Damascus/Bennett)

- Your entire playthrough matters, but Episodes 9-10 are most crucial
- Build ideological alignment through all dialogue choices
- In final interrogations, maximize empathy with your chosen leader
- Exploit ideological conflicts between leaders
- For Damascus: discuss private property and individual freedom
- For Anaba: focus on collectivism and equality
- For Bennett: emphasize order, tradition, and strength

#### For "Cure For The Plague"

- Start a fresh playthrough with this ending in mind
- Choose "Messiah Complex" trait when available
- Recruit Jonathan (4th team member) and agree with extrajudicial methods
- Build mental instability through excessive violence
- In final interrogations, use fear rather than empathy
- Can sometimes be achieved by replaying Episodes 9-10 with extreme pressure

### Combat System Misconceptions

- There is no traditional combat - all confrontations are verbal/psychological
- "Enhanced interrogation" is the closest thing to physical gameplay
- Success comes from understanding psychology, not reaction time
- The game is more like a complex puzzle than an action game

### Time Management

- **Challenge Mode**: Timer decreases with each question asked
- **Narrative Mode**: More forgiving timers or no time pressure
- Plan your question path before starting timed interrogations
- Some red herring options waste valuable time
- Failing due to time allows you to retry with knowledge of dead ends

- One Challenge Mode playthrough for episode achievements
- Additional playthroughs or save manipulation for all five endings

A: Very important. Team morale affects:

- Mission success rates (gathering crucial information)
- Available options in later episodes
- Multiple achievements
- Your character's mental state
- Public perception of your department

### Q: Which memories/traits should I choose?

A: Depends on your goals:

- **For pacifist runs**: Choose traits that boost empathy and disable torture

- **For easier interrogations**: Statistical analysis traits help read suspects
- **For role-playing**: Choose traits that match your intended playthrough style

### Q: I can't unlock certain dialogue options in Episode 10. Why?

- **Execution**: Extreme pragmatism at moral cost

The game intentionally avoids presenting any solution as definitively correct.

## Final Notes

"Interrogation: You Will Be Deceived" is a game that rewards careful thought, multiple playthroughs, and moral flexibility. While this guide provides the mechanical steps to achieve all endings and achievements, the true experience comes from grappling with the ethical dilemmas presented.

Remember that the game wants to open your mind rather than change it. Each playthrough can offer new insights into the characters, their motivations, and the complex web of ideology and violence that drives the narrative.

Whether you choose to be a by-the-book detective, a pragmatic operator willing to bend rules, or descend into becoming the very evil you fight against, the game ensures that every choice has weight and consequence.

Good luck, detective. The city is counting on you... but at what cost?
