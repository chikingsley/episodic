## Chapter 1: The Tutorial

### The First Drill Session

You begin in a training session for the Investigative Interview and Interrogation Techniques course.

> **Instructor:** Welcome. This will be the first drill session... We'll be bringing in a subject. They're a trained actor... Before any interrogation, the first thing to do is to consult the subject's file.

### Case File: Douglas Byrd
>
> **Incident Narrative:** Douglas Byrd, despite coming from well-off parents, has taken to bike theft. We have plenty of circumstantial evidence... we need to leverage all the leads in order to get a full confession.
>
> **Suspect Bio:** Douglas Byrd is our main suspect for several bicycle thefts at a local university campus. Several eyewitnesses confirmed his description. We also have CCTV footage showing a masked figure matching the suspect's description... He is currently listed as unemployed, living in a rented apartment paid for by his parents. His criminal record is clean, but he is known to be friends with several narcotics abusers, as well as a roommate who is a suspected marijuana dealer.

### Interrogation: Douglas Byrd

The goal is to get a confession by manipulating the suspect's emotional state, tracked by pupil dilation (openness) and heart rate (fear).

1. **Direct Accusation (Fails):**
    * **Player Choice:** Let's talk about writing a confession. We both know you did it.
    * **Byrd:** *Looks at you in disbelief.* We don't know nothing. I'm not signing nothing.

2. **Initial Probing (Fails):**
    * **Player Choice:** So, why do you steal bikes, Douglas?
    * **Byrd:** I ain't steal no bikes, broseph.

3. **Building a Connection (Empathy):**
    * **Player Strategy:** Start off soft to build rapport and make the suspect more open.
    * **Player Choice:** Can't believe they have me chasing bikes. Why can't people just lock them up proper?
    * **Byrd:** *Seems amused.* It's fucking stupid, man. Waste taxpayer money and all that.
    * **Player Choice:** A living's expensive. I know. I used to crack payphones when I was a teen.
    * **Byrd:** *With a tinge of disbelief.* Weren't you a thug? Trained actor, huh?
    * *(Byrd's pupils dilate, indicating he is more open).*

4. **Inducing Fear:**
    * **Player Strategy:** Intimidate the suspect without jumping to big threats immediately.
    * **Player Choice:** You know how many months you do for a bike theft?
    * **Byrd:** *Timidly.* Nah, man... No, I... I am worried about that.
    * *(Byrd's heart rate increases, indicating fear).*
    * **Player Choice:** And hey, you're tough. You'll be fine in prison, I'm sure.
    * **Byrd:** *Avoids your gaze.* What? What? You don't know the time for snatching bikes, do you? My dad works for a senator, you know. I'll be fine.
    * **Player Choice:** Oh, you think the senator will risk his career for the sake of a bike-snatching kid? Really?
    * **Byrd:** *Shifting in his seat in distress.* Probably not. Fuck! Shit!

5. **Enhanced Interrogation:**
    * The instructor explains you can go off the record to use "enhanced interrogation" to increase fear.
    * **Player Choice:** Let's hear the electro-truth.
    * **Byrd:** *Breathes heavily, distressed and displeased.*
    * *(Byrd is now terrified).*

6. **Securing the Confession:**
    * **Player Strategy:** With the suspect terrified, press the accusation again, but use language appropriate for a scared subject.
    * **Player Choice:** Let's talk about writing a confession.
    * **Byrd:** *Concerned.* Why? No, no, no. I would like... I would... that involved, though?
    * **Player Choice:** Listen, you lowlife. Sign this damn confession right now. Maybe we can keep your dumb ass out of jail.
    * **Byrd:** *In despair.* Fuck man. Fuck fuck... Okay, okay, alright. I'll sign.

## Chapter 2: The Peterson Case

### Briefing
>
> **Chief Anderson:** Hey, I need you to come in on a case. Fisher's brought in a set of guys... we have the vic's husband, the only witness, and the robber that broke in. We need your questioning magic in there. A confession, because all we have is circumstantial.
> **Player:** Yes, sir.
> **Chief Anderson:** The story is this: cocksucker broke in, armed with a low-cal piece, holding this Peterson up... Wife comes in, jumps on the phone. Cox drops her with two shots to the back before bolting. We have the gun, no prints... Peterson was as cool as a cucumber, his wife's body just lying in the other room... Anyway, check out the files, grill 'em, cross-examination... give me a confession. You have this.

### Case Files

> **Incident Narrative:** Heather Peterson was murdered in her living room in front of her husband, Darrell Peterson. He claims a burglar broke in... threatened them, tied them up, and subsequently shot Mrs. Peterson as she tried to use her cell phone... We managed to track down the burglar, one Jerry "Munch" Cox... The gun was found outside... Munch strongly denies committing the murder. What complicates things is Mr. Darrell Peterson's attitude... described him as "disturbingly serene."
>
> **Jerry "Munch" Cox:** Alias "Munch," identified as the burglar. Criminal record is quite colorful... but he does not have a past record of violent crime of any sort.
>
> **Darrell Peterson:** Husband of the victim... he is the sole witness. The first detective on the scene reported Peterson displaying unusual calm and composure. Peterson has a clean record and there is no evidence that points to any wrongdoing on his part.

### Interrogation: Jerry "Munch" Cox

The player attempts to establish a motive or means for Cox but hits a dead end.

* **On the Burglary:**
  * **Cox:** After I jumped in, I heard voices inside the apartment somewhere. It sounded like they were fighting or something.
  * **Player Choice:** Did you hear what they were fighting about?
  * **Cox:** What do you think I am, in the CIA? ... I got my ass out of there as soon as I noticed somebody was in the house.
* **On the Murder Weapon:**
  * **Cox:** Someone must have dropped it or something. I told you, I know nothing about the murder.
  * **Player Choice:** Have you ever owned a gun?
  * **Cox:** Fuck, I know it ain't illegal and my story doesn't need helping 'cuz it's true. I don't touch guns. They're trouble.

### Interrogation: Darrell Peterson

The player's strategy is to build empathy and trust by agreeing with Peterson's worldview, making him open up about his personal life and extremist beliefs.

1. **Building Empathy:**
    * **Player Choice:** The first few hours must be hard. How are you handling the loss?
    * **Peterson:** *Calmly.* We have to move on, don't we?
    * **Player Choice:** We're doing the best we can to make sure the culprit will be put behind bars. But I need your help to do that.
    * **Peterson:** *Calmly.* This is good to hear. Thank you. I hope I can help.
    * **Player Choice:** You do seem like a tough guy. You're self-sufficient.
    * **Peterson:** *Calmly.* Oh yes, I hope so too.

2. **Uncovering Means (The Gun):**
    * **Player Choice:** Do you plan on joining a group or something?
    * **Peterson:** The neighborhood watch is the only group I plan on joining. Make sure I put that gun of mine to some good use.
    * *(This reveals Peterson owns a gun).*

3. **Uncovering Motive (Resentment):**
    * **Player Choice:** Have you taken leave from work to deal with this?
    * **Peterson:** There's no need for that. They fired me months ago.
    * **Player Choice:** So your wife was the primary earner?
    * **Peterson:** *Looks away.* Well, yes... she was quite proud of it too. Rubbed it in my face with each opportunity she had.
    * **Player Choice:** I assume you were fighting over this on the night of the break-in as well, right?
    * **Peterson:** *Shrugs stiffly.* Actually, yes.
    * **Player Choice:** It must have been so frustrating for you, her constant pestering.
    * **Peterson:** *Lost in thought.* Yes, I guess it was. I just had enough, you know... She could be such a shrew sometimes, I'm telling you.
    * **Player Choice:** So that's why you seem so composed about the situation. You actually hated her.
    * **Peterson:** *Voice lowers to a near whisper.* I... I did. Yes... I can't help but feel relief.

4. **Uncovering Extremist Ideology:**
    * **Player Choice:** It seems like you believe very strongly in justice.
    * **Peterson:** Yes, I believe this world we live in needs a bit of a change.
    * **Player Choice:** Vigilante justice, you think that's the solution?
    * **Peterson:** There is so much filth out there... If honest people like you and me don't take action, the filth will drown us all.
    * **Player Choice:** Just you and me, that won't change much, don't you think?
    * **Peterson:** There's many of us out there who think like this. We found each other online... we mostly meet online, forums, boards, chat rooms...
    * **Player Choice:** Which sort of plans are we talking about?
    * **Peterson:** It will certainly be big... It's all very exciting to be part of... the Liberation Front.

5. **Securing the Confession:**
    * **Player Choice:** If you believe in justice as you say, confess.
    * **Peterson:** *Tears start coming out of his angry eyes.* She... she should've treated me with more respect. She deserved it. And so does my stupid boss... If we don't take things into our own hands, nothing will ever change. I thought you understood that too.

## Chapter 3: The Horn Bunny 49 Password

### Forming the Task Force
>
> **Chief Anderson:** Good work in there. I have something important I need to discuss with you... This Liberation Front business you've got out of Peterson, it seems to be pretty serious stuff... I've talked it over with the powers that be and we've decided you're the best person for the job. You'll be heading up a small unit to combat these guys... Not gonna lie, this unit will mean all eyes will be on you. Try and keep everyone happy, but most importantly, stop these bastards.

Your new unit is introduced:

* **Tab Thompson:** Analyst extraordinaire.
* **Jennifer Reyes:** Organized Crime Department's best.
* **Mordecai Fisher:** From Homicide.

> **Jennifer:** Jennifer shall we head out and talk some shop over at Hannigan's? Is that a bar?
> **Tab:** The meeting room is not being used.
> **Player Choice:** Let's take the meeting room.
> **Jennifer:** We've got some live action, boss. Morty's out there with some badges grabbing our three suspects for who that Horn Bunny might be.
> **Tab:** I do hope Mr. Fisher practices restraint. I know him to be rather abrasive.
> **Player Choice:** I'm sure he means well.

### Case Files: Horn Bunny 49
>
> **Incident Narrative:** The Liberation Front is plotting online using password-protected forums... Following Peterson's tip, we tracked down the main chatroom... We've managed to find a username that has the special permission required: Horn Bunny 49... we've managed to narrow down the user ID to three possible individuals... We only have minutes to find a password.

* **Diana O'Donnell:** Alternative model, hosts a blog critiquing modern lifestyle.
* **Michael Lemon:** Pet stylist, aficionado of underground theater, Democracy Party member.
* **Fred Ennis:** Risk analyst for a major bank, thrice divorced, practices airsoft.

### Timed Interrogation (7:00)

The goal is to find Horn Bunny 49 and get the password before the timer runs out.

1. **Initial Questioning:** The player questions Diana and Michael about the nickname "Horn Bunny" but they are evasive. Fred Ennis, however, gives a nickname.
    * **Player Choice (to Fred):** What nickname do you use?
    * **Ennis:** Cat Lover 5.

2. **Cross-Referencing:** The player uses this information to check with the other suspects.
    * **Player Choice (to Michael):** Do you know Cat Lover 5?
    * **Michael:** I know the chat room pretty well, and I'm pretty sure I've never seen anyone with that handle.

3. **Confronting the Liar:** The player returns to Fred and confronts him.
    * **Player Choice:** We've asked around, Fred. There's no Cat Lover 5 in that chatroom.
    * **Ennis:** *Shocked and troubled.* I'm Horn Bunny 49, okay?

4. **Applying Pressure:** Fred is reluctant to give up the password. The player needs to scare him.
    * **Player Choice:** What do you think of the Liberation Front?
    * **Ennis:** I see their points. The world really isn't what it should be.
    * **Player Choice:** The last Liberation Front sympathizer we've had in here left with broken legs.
    * *(Ennis becomes visibly nervous).*

5. **Getting the Password:** With his fear level high, Fred is pressed for the password.
    * **Player Choice:** What's the password to the special room, Fred?
    * **Ennis:** *Cracks.* Alright, you're right. I'll give you the password... Excelsior.

### Post-Mission

* **Press Release:** You choose how to word the press release about the arrest.
  * **Chosen Headline:** *In response to the recent upsurge in terrorist activity... the SDPD assembled the Peace and Stability special unit.*
  * **Chosen Detail:** *This operation has led to the interview and eventual arrest of Fred Ennis, a suspected collaborator.*
* **Skill Selection:**
  * **Player Choice:** Scholar of Ideology - You have keenly studied extremist ideology and may use that knowledge when talking to people with radical convictions.

## Chapter 4: Task Force Management & Press Interview

### The Algorithm Dilemma
>
> **Jennifer:** Now that we're logged in... they seem to be using code words. I can set up a smart algorithm... or we can simply try to figure it out directly.
> **Player Choice:** Do both. Set up the algorithm and also try to figure out manually.
> **Jennifer:** Don't give me that look... this will mean that both of us will be busy working on this. We may have a hard time responding to other issues that pop up.
> **Player Choice:** Do both anyway.
> **Jennifer:** We are a crack squad of the ST PD.

## Chapter 5: The Mall Bombing

### A Private Conversation
>
> **Jennifer:** Hey boss, wanted to clear the water about some stuff... Chief Lucas was looking at the two of us to see who should head up this task force. I guess you acing the Peterson grill made it a done deal... Fucking rumors fly really easily, so just wanted to reassure you that I'm fully on board, right behind you.
> **Player Choice:** I'm glad to hear it. Let's do good work.
> **Jennifer:** Ten-four, boss.

### The Plot
>
> **Jennifer:** I've been at it for a while now and I've managed to figure out what most key words mean... I think I've stumbled onto something big. The South Bank Mall, something today. The planting of a package... in front of the Duathlon store.
> **Tab:** We should have the police canvassed ASAP. Let's move.

### Case Files
>
> **Incident Narrative:** ...two of the individuals... were involved in a conflict. Daniel Wilson, a security guard... forcefully apprehended Vakeel Madan, and exposed that the latter... carried a concealed firearm. The third individual, Samantha Lowe, was seen talking to Daniel Wilson... The chat room conversation revealed that at least one of these individuals was due to signal the successful planting of a time bomb...

* **Daniel Wilson:** Retired Marine, struggles with mother's medical bills. Security guard at the mall.
* **Samantha Lowe:** Interior decorator, animal rights activist. IP has accessed Liberation Front content.
* **Vakeel Madan:** Arrived on an expired student visa, likely working on the black market.

### Timed Interrogation

The bomb is on a timer. The player's strategy is to build empathy to convince the bomber to give up the location.

1. **Clearing Suspects:** The player quickly determines Vakeel is likely just an immigrant with an illegal gun for protection and that Samantha is a dead end. The focus shifts to Daniel Wilson.

2. **Building Empathy with Wilson:**
    * **Player Choice (on apprehending Vakeel):** I follow my guts all the time... I do what's necessary on a case-by-case basis.
    * **Wilson:** *Nods.* Nice.
    * **Player Choice:** Good work, soldier. You got a bad guy.
    * **Wilson:** *Nods.* Thank you.

3. **Uncovering Motive (Financial Desperation):**
    * **Player Choice:** Any family?
    * **Wilson:** Just my mom. She's probably worried... She's sick, so I take care of her.
    * **Player Choice:** Medical bills must be expensive.
    * **Wilson:** *Sadness in his voice.* I don't want to talk about that.

4. **Getting the Confession:**
    * **Player Strategy:** With empathy high and his motive understood, the player presses him directly.
    * **Player Choice:** Where's the bomb, Daniel?
    * **Wilson:** I... I had to. I'm sorry. They forced me.
    * **Player Choice:** Wilson, they said they'd help with your mother's bills, didn't they?
    * **Wilson:** *Shame in his voice.* They said they'd take care of her... Mom... It's on the fifth floor. Shallow's Bits store. Third dressing room on the right.

### Aftermath

You defuse the bomb at the mall, but two other bombs explode elsewhere in the city. Public opinion of your task force plummets.

* **Press Release:** You word the announcement of Wilson's arrest.
  * **Chosen Detail:** *At this point we are working under the assumption that he was part of a larger terrorist cell.*
  * **Chosen Motive:** *His criminal acts were motivated by blackmail and threats made against his family by the Front.*

***

## Chapter 6: Post-Bombing Management & Team Building

### Team Morale
>
> **Mordecai:** Jeez... sorry, boss.
> **Player Choice:** Trying to stop murderers doesn't make us in any way responsible.
> **Mordecai:** We didn't figure it out in time, guys.
> **Player:** Well, let's buckle down.

### City Hall
>
> **Chief Anderson:** Good evening everyone. We need the room, please. I have someone here from City Hall to talk to you.
> **Tristan Miller:** Greetings, detective. My name is Tristan Miller. I assist Mayor Patel... these deaths, obviously... they don't look good for any of us. We're relying on your task force to end what is surely the greatest threat to the city... Can we count on your team?
> **Player Choice:** The Liberation Front will be shut down.

### Skill Selection

* **Player Choice:** Profiler - Reading reactions and emotional states now assigns you an exact evaluation in numbers of how fearful and empathetic the subjects are.

### Management Phase 2

* **Budget Allocation:**
  * Informer Stimulants ($500)
  * Therapy ($1000)
  * Bonus for Senior Officer ($1000)
* **Agent Missions:**
  * **Mordecai:** Consult with explosives forensics. (Success)
  * **Jennifer:** Pursue informers. (Success)
  * **Tab:** Do paperwork ("By the book"). (Success)

### Team Building
>
> **Jennifer:** Hey boss, I'm gonna meet the others at Hannigan's. Try to get our minds off this craziness... Want to join?
> **Player Choice:** Team building. Team building.

You join your team for drinks at Hannigan's Bar.
> **Jennifer:** My picks: MLK, Mary Lionheart, kill Louis the 16th, definitely.
> **Mordecai:** Burner's Crusader babies has a ring to it.
> **Tab:** Or a boss's turn, right? Let's see... Marry, Kiss, Lincoln, Gandhi, and Thatcher.
> **Player Choice:** Mary Lincoln... And then of course they kill Lincoln from behind.
> **Jennifer:** Next round's on me.

### Reports Review

* **Mission Reports:** The team found bomb residue, has a lead on a girl whose boyfriend may be involved with the Front, and got appreciation for their balanced books.
* **Newspaper:** An article features an exclusive interview with a former Liberation Front "sleeper agent" named Eric, who details the group's decentralized structure and broad appeal.
* **Personnel Files:** You discover Mordecai was involved in an armed robbery as a teen and received immunity for testifying against his co-conspirators.

***

## Chapter 7: The Office Building Bombing

### The Puzzle
>
> **Mordecai:** We have some good news and some bad news. Good news is they had the elevator cameras... Bad news is they weren't stored digitally... and the picture corresponding to the button press we're interested in was missing... After several hours of trash digging... I was able to track down these scraps.

You must reassemble the shredded photo. The completed image shows a priest, a woman, and another man.

### Case Files
>
> **Incident Narrative:** ...one of the explosions happened in a large downtown office building... on the 13th floor... The floor was being renovated... By sifting through the recordings... we managed to identify three people who briefly stayed on the 13th floor...

* **Maya Clarke:** A sales manager who worked in the building. No criminal record.
* **Alex Novak:** Has had several name changes, suspected of suffering from schizophrenia. Receiving care from a charity, Humanitas, founded by Gabriel Adams.
* **Gabriel Adams:** A well-known local priest. His charity, Humanitas, was renovating the 13th floor to be its new headquarters.

### Interrogation

The player's strategy is to destabilize the psychologically fragile Alex Novak to get information to use against the apparent mastermind, Gabriel Adams.

1. **Interrogating Alex Novak:**
    * **Player Strategy:** Instead of calming Alex, the player chooses to feed his paranoia.
    * **Player Choice:** You've been on our radar for quite some time, Alex.
    * **Alex:** *Panicked.* You won't get me alive! I didn't do anything, though.
    * The player learns Alex believes "they" were after him and that the building was targeted for its "poor structural design." The player continues to agree with his conspiracy theories.
    * **Player Choice:** The nanobots have reached your brain by this point. You have no choice but to comply.
    * **Alex:** *Slouching, demeanor changes.* We're both the recipients and the generators of guilt. The cycle cannot be broken.
    * *(Alex is now completely detached from reality, speaking in cryptic phrases he has been told).*

2. **Extracting Information from Alex:**
    * **Player Choice:** Tell me what you chose to do.
    * **Alex:** The man said, "Give me three gallons. Make sure it says 'nitromethane' on them. Bring them over, but don't shake them too hard."
    * **Player Choice:** Where did you get all these ideas from?
    * **Alex:** Father Gabriel told me I could choose.

3. **Confronting Gabriel Adams:**
    * **Player Strategy:** Use the information gathered from Alex to break the priest.
    * **Player Choice:** Father, why is Alex buying nitromethane?
    * **Adams:** *Stunned.* What? ... Did he tell you that?
    * **Player Choice:** He told me many things... Answer me now.
    * **Adams:** *Stammering.* It was for my hobby. I build airplane models...
    * The player also brings up the "new biblical flood" concept that Alex mentioned.
    * **Player Choice:** Alex tells me you believe that we are about to face a new biblical flood.
    * **Adams:** *Concerned.* The devil is taking deep roots, but do not lose hope. God will extend his helping hand... give us a fresh start.

4. **Securing the Confession:**
    * **Player Choice:** I have you on record claiming the apocalypse is coming... I also have you confessing to ordering the purchase of extremely flammable materials... You planted the bomb. You wanted to bring this new flood yourself. Confess, priest.
    * **Adams:** You might think you can stop it, you winning agent of Satan, but it is unavoidable. Our children will walk in the kingdom of God after the flood cleanses the souls of the wicked.

### Press Release

You announce the arrest of Gabriel Adams, detailing his methods and the role of Alex Novak.

* **Chosen Detail:** *He was aided in this by Alex Novak... due to his circumstances, he will not be charged but placed into a mental health facility.*

## Chapter 8: You Are Interrogated

*(Note: This chapter's detailed walkthrough is based on the supplementary transcript.)*

### The Setup

You are now the one being interrogated by an internal affairs officer, who questions your methods, successes, and potential sympathies for the Liberation Front.

> **Officer:** Do you understand why you're here, detective?

The strategy is to remain professional, justify your actions as calculated risks for the greater good, and firmly deny any incompetence or allegiance to the enemy.

1. **Addressing Failures:**
    * **Officer:** Do we have any ethical breaches that we would like to declare?
    * **Player Choice:** We know that giving up Ben Avis was a bad thing. We took a calculated risk.

2. **Defending Your Methods:**
    * **Officer:** Why do we have this magical gift of getting confessions?
    * **Player Choice:** We're good at what we do. (Avoids admitting to illegal methods or implying a connection to the Front).
    * **Officer:** Do you find it acceptable that we've psychologically tormented several of these suspects?
    * **Player Choice:** I would regret it deeply if we did.

3. **Refuting Sympathy:**
    * **Officer:** You were too sympathetic to the Liberation Front's points of view.
    * **Player Choice:** We tried to trick them.
    * **Officer:** *Screaming.* Are you ready to die to end these monsters?
    * **Player Choice:** We're not fanatics. We stand for the law.

By navigating these questions without admitting to wrongdoing or showing weakness, you pass the interrogation and keep your job.

***

## Chapter 9: The Core Leaders

*(Note: This chapter's detailed walkthrough is based on the supplementary transcript.)*

### The Choice

You are given a choice of four high-profile suspects and can only bring in two. A key hint is that you must select either **Anomaly** (a sociology professor) or **Damascus Reed** (an entrepreneur) to succeed. For this playthrough, both are selected.

### Interrogation

The goal is to turn the leaders against each other. You must balance empathy and fear, convincing one that the other is a liability to the Liberation Front's true cause.

1. **Building Empathy with Damascus Reed:**
    * **Player Strategy:** Be polite and agree with his capitalist worldview.
    * **Player Choice:** Finally, a public servant that understands how the state works.
    * *(Reed's empathy rises. He trusts you enough to give "theoretical" advice on how a group like the Front would operate).*

2. **Inducing Fear and Doubt:**
    * **Player Strategy:** After building trust, introduce fear by suggesting the other leaders will ruin his vision if he's the only one jailed.
    * **Player Choice (on funding):** In return, the Liberation Front might be harming their competitors.
    * *(Reed's heart rate spikes).*
    * **Player Choice (on leadership):** If one of the leaders were to leave, the balance of power would be disturbed.
    * *(This plants a seed of doubt).*

3. **Using Personal Conflict:**
    * The player learns from Anomaly that she and Reed have a contentious history.
    * **Player Choice (to Anomaly):** What's your connection to Damascus?
    * **Anomaly:** *Claims they had sex in Saigon.*
    * **Player Choice (to Reed):** *Confronts Reed with this information.*
    * *(This personal leverage, combined with ideological differences, pushes one to betray the other).*

4. **Securing the Betrayal:**
    * **Player Choice:** You can either go to prison and let the Liberation Front be stolen from you, or you can give us something we can use.
    * **Reed:** *Agrees to make an opening.* He gives you two other names, potential leaders, to save his own skin and vision for the Front.

***

## Chapter 10: The Grand Finale

*(Note: This chapter's detailed walkthrough is based on the supplementary transcript.)*

### The Final Interrogation

You have the three core leaders in separate rooms: **Anomaly**, **Damascus Reed**, and **James Bennett** (a former soldier). You cannot use enhanced interrogation, and they cannot incriminate themselves. The only way to win is to make each one of them incriminate the other two.

The strategy is to run a "make-believe exercise" where each leader consults on how a hypothetical version of the Front would be run, exposing their ideological and personal conflicts.

1. **Turning Anomaly against Reed:**
    * **Exercise:** "Perfect Equity" (Marxist). Anomaly outlines her vision.
    * **Exercise:** "Absolute Freedom" (Anarcho-Capitalist). Anomaly describes the leader as a "narcissistic know-it-all," clearly aimed at Reed.
    * **Leverage:** The player uses Reed's claim that they were intimate to anger Anomaly.
    * **Result:** Anomaly signs a confession incriminating Reed, claiming his "greed is perverting the Front."

2. **Turning Reed against Bennett:**
    * **Exercise:** "Burning Down the World" (Apocalyptic). Reed is asked to consult on a cell led by a military fanatic.
    * **Leverage:** The player learns from Bennett that he raises his sons with extreme survivalist training. When Reed is told this, he is disgusted.
    * **Player Choice:** Bennett is a monster.
    * **Result:** Reed, already given up by Anomaly, decides Bennett's fanaticism is a threat and signs a confession against him.

3. **Turning Bennett against Anomaly:**
    * **Exercise:** "Perfect Equity." Bennett consults on a cell led by an intellectual. He describes the leader as "giving speeches, talking too much, delegating irresponsibly." He is angered by the "culture of total acceptance."
    * **Leverage:** The player tells Bennett that Anomaly's ideology is "diluting the Front" and will do it "a lot of harm."
    * **Player Choice:** Can you give her up to me?
    * **Result:** Convinced that Anomaly is a weak link who threatens the core strength of the movement, Bennett agrees to sign a confession against her.

With all three leaders having turned on each other, you have successfully dismantled the Liberation Front's leadership, winning the game.
