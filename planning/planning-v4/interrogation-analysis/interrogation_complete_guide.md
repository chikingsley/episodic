## Game Overview

"Interrogation: You will be deceived" is a narrative puzzle game in a noir detective setting developed by Critique Gaming and published by Mixtvision. Released on December 5, 2019, this 5-6 hour psychological thriller puts you in the role of an unnamed detective leading a special task force to dismantle a dangerous terrorist organization known as The Liberation Front.

### Key Features

- Hand-drawn black and white animations created by rotoscoping over 1000 photos of more than 40 actors
- Complex conversational puzzles with psychological manipulation mechanics
- Team and resource management between interrogations
- Multiple branching storylines with five distinct endings
- Deep exploration of moral and ethical dilemmas
- Symbolic (non-graphic) depictions of performing torture

The game has been compared to titles like "Papers, Please," "This War of Mine," and "Orwell" for its attempts to raise important moral, ideological and practical questions about contemporary issues including terrorism, police brutality, and power imbalances.

## Foreword

**WARNING: THIS GUIDE CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS**

This comprehensive guide is designed to help achievement hunters obtain all achievements in "Interrogation: You Will Be Deceived." I strongly recommend playing through the game at least once blind before using this guide, as knowing the outcomes and strategies will significantly impact your first-time experience.

**Important Note**: This game deals with mature themes including radical ideologies, human casualties resulting from terrorism and contains symbolic (non-graphic) depictions of performing torture. The narrative challenges players to confront difficult moral choices about the means used to achieve justice.

## Core Game Mechanics

### Interrogation System

The heart of the game revolves around psychological interrogations where you must extract information from suspects through various methods:

#### Psychological Meters

- **Heart Rate (Fear)**: Indicates how afraid or stressed the suspect is. A higher heart rate means more fear.
- **Pupil Dilation (Openness)**: Shows how receptive or trusting they are toward you. A wider pupil means more openness.

These meters are crucial for determining your approach. A frightened subject may be more responsive to threats, while an open one could be convinced with sympathy.

**Example in Action:** In the tutorial with Douglas Byrd, you can see this in action. Initially, asking direct questions like "Why do you steal bikes?" fails. But shifting to an empathetic approach ("Can't believe they have me chasing bikes") makes his pupil meter dilate, showing he's more open to talk. Later, threatening him with prison time ("You know how many months you do for a bike theft?") makes his heart rate spike, indicating fear.

#### Interrogation Techniques

1. **Empathy**: Building rapport and trust with suspects.
2. **Intimidation**: Using fear and pressure to break down resistance.
3. **Manipulation**: Exploiting psychological vulnerabilities, often by using information from their file or other suspects.
4. **Enhanced Interrogation**: Turning off the recorder to use physical methods.

### Enhanced Interrogation (Torture) Mechanics

At any point in the interrogation, you can turn off the recorder and select a variety of torture options. These include:

- Getting in the suspect's face
- Slamming them against walls
- Using implements like knives or tasers
- More extreme methods unlocked through certain "memories" (traits)

**Important**: You can even overdo it, incapacitating them. In mechanical terms, it usually causes fear levels to skyrocket. However, using these methods has severe consequences:

- Damages your public reputation
- Affects team morale
- Can lead to false confessions from innocent suspects
- Impacts which endings become available
- May result in your character developing mental instability

**Example of Consequences:** The playthrough demonstrates that while using the taser on Byrd makes him "terrified" and leads to a quick confession, the instructor immediately warns you about the consequences. This establishes early on that these methods, while effective for raising fear, come at a cost to your professional standing and reputation.

**Specific Consequence Examples:**

**Episode 2 - Immediate Feedback:**

- Using taser on suspects until unconscious triggers instructor warnings
- Multiple uses in one episode can lead to early termination
- Team members witness and judge your methods

**Progressive Reputation Damage:**

- **First Use:** Team expresses concern, slight reputation hit
- **Repeated Use:** Media criticism, public protests outside department
- **Excessive Use:** Formal complaints, budget cuts, potential firing

**Mental Instability Development:**

- Character develops "Mad Genius" traits through excessive violence
- Unlocks more extreme interrogation methods
- Required for "Cure For The Plague" ending
- Affects available dialogue options in later episodes

**Team Morale Impact:**

- Jennifer becomes distant if methods conflict with her values
- Mordecai questions leadership decisions
- Tab may refuse certain missions
- Affects mission success rates and available story paths

**Public Perception Examples:**

- Leaked footage can trigger citywide protests
- Assassination attempts become possible with very low approval
- Press conferences become hostile interrogations of your methods
- Community informants stop cooperating

### Team Management System

Between interrogations, you manage a team of three core investigators, each with their own skills and moral boundaries:

#### Team Mechanics

- **Motivation Levels**: Each team member has individual morale that affects mission success rates.
- **Mission Assignments**: Send team members to gather intelligence, work with informants, or handle public relations.
- **Budget Allocation**: Limited resources must be divided between:
  - Team development and morale
  - Information gathering missions
  - Public relations efforts
  - Emergency responses

#### Key Team Interactions

The game includes narrative scenes that develop your team's characters and affect morale.

**Example 1: Clearing the Air:** In Chapter 5, Jennifer approaches you to "clear the water" about the leadership role. Your response—such as "I'm glad to hear it. Let's do good work"—directly impacts your relationship with her and sets a collaborative tone for the team.

**Example 2: Team Building at Hannigan's:** After the mall bombing, Jennifer offers to go for drinks at "Hannigan's." Choosing to go leads to a team-building scene where you play 'Marry, Kiss, Kill' with historical figures:

- **Jennifer:** "My picks: MLK, Mary Lionheart, kill Louis the 16th, definitely."
- **Mordecai:** "Burner's Crusader babies has a ring to it."
- **Tab:** "Or a boss's turn, right? Let's see... Marry, Kiss, Lincoln, Gandhi, and Thatcher."
- **Player Choice:** "Mary Lincoln... And then of course they kill Lincoln from behind."

This scene has no immediate gameplay benefit but serves to boost morale and flesh out team personalities.

**Additional Team Interactions:**

- After-work drinks to boost morale (multiple opportunities)
- Consulting with experts and informants through mission assignments
- Managing conflicting personalities and approaches during briefings
- Balancing workload to prevent burnout (affects mission success rates)
- Personal conversations that reveal backstories and build loyalty

**Budget Allocation Examples That Work:**

- **Early Game:** Order HR Report ($500), Procedure Training ($1500)
- **Mid Game:** Informer Stimulants ($500), Therapy ($1000), Bonus for Senior Officer ($1000)  
- **Crisis Response:** Emergency funding for rapid response, team counseling after traumatic events
- **Morale Maintenance:** Regular team building expenses, equipment upgrades, overtime compensation

**Mission Assignment Strategy:**

- **Mordecai:** Excels at fieldwork, forensics, tracking physical evidence
- **Jennifer:** Best for informant relations, organized crime connections, chatroom analysis
- **Tab:** Ideal for technical analysis, paperwork, by-the-book operations
- **Cross-training:** Occasionally assign outside comfort zones to build versatility

### Reputation System

Your actions affect three key reputation metrics:

1. **Public Opinion**: How citizens view your department.
   - Affected by: Use of force, press statements, and preventing attacks.
   - High reputation brings support; low reputation risks protests or assassination.

2. **Press Relations**: Media coverage of your activities.
   - Affected by: Transparency, press conferences, and leaks.
   - High reputation leads to favorable coverage; low reputation brings scrutiny.

3. **Authority Approval**: Support from police hierarchy and government.
   - Affected by: Case success rate, following protocol, and political alignment.
   - High reputation brings resources; low reputation leads to budget cuts or being fired.

### Memory System (Character Traits)

Throughout the game, you'll choose "memories" that define your detective's background and approach, unlocking unique dialogue and actions.

#### Examples of Memories

- **Pacifist**: Cannot use enhanced interrogation but gains empathy bonuses.
- **Scholar of Ideology/Trained Ideologist**: Unlocks dialogue options about political theory. The playthrough shows this being chosen after the Horn Bunny 49 case, anticipating future ideological battles.
- **Profiler/Statistical Expert**: Provides numerical precision for psychological meters.
- **Mad Genius**: Associated with mental instability and extreme methods.
- **Messiah Complex**: Believes in extrajudicial justice.
- **Double Agent**: Allows unique infiltration dialogue options.

These traits significantly affect available dialogue options, interrogation methods, and potential endings.

## The Liberation Front - Understanding the Factions

The Liberation Front is an implausibly slippery alliance of left, right, and libertarian partisans all at once, united in their opposition to the current system but divided in their vision for the future. Understanding these ideological divisions is crucial for successful interrogations and achieving specific endings.

### The Three Leaders (The Triumvirate)

#### 1. Anaba Lee - The Collectivist Wing

- **Ideology**: Socialist/communist ideals focused on equality and collective ownership.
- **Followers**: Activists, social justice advocates, community organizers.
- **Key Beliefs**: Wealth redistribution, dismantling class structures, collective decision-making.
- **Interrogation Approach**: Responds to discussions about inequality, social justice, and community.
- **Associated Ending**: "No Kings, No Destinies"

#### 2. Damascus Reed - The Individualist Wing

- **Ideology**: Libertarian/anarcho-capitalist focused on personal freedom and minimal government.
- **Followers**: Entrepreneurs, tech libertarians, free-market advocates.
- **Key Beliefs**: Stateless society, private property rights, individual sovereignty.
- **Interrogation Approach**: Responds to discussions about freedom, markets, and individual rights.
- **Associated Ending**: "Never Tread On Me"

#### 3. Colonel James Bennett - The Authoritarian Wing

- **Ideology**: Right-wing authoritarianism focused on order and traditional hierarchy.
- **Followers**: Military personnel, traditionalists, those seeking strong leadership.
- **Key Beliefs**: Social cleansing, restoration of order, elimination of perceived degeneracy.
- **Interrogation Approach**: Responds to discussions about strength, order, and tradition.
- **Associated Ending**: "Evolve Or Die"

### Faction Dynamics

- Bennett and Lee are ideological opposites and despise each other.
- Reed occupies a middle ground but has personal connections with both.
- Damascus had "amazing sex in Saigon" with Anaba - a detail that can be exploited in Episode 10.
- Each leader can be manipulated to betray the others by exploiting ideological differences.
- **Personal Conflicts:** These are as important as ideological ones for successful manipulation.

**Detailed Relationship Web:**

- **Anaba ↔ Damascus:** Former intimate relationship creates personal animosity when exploited
- **Damascus ↔ Bennett:** Disgusted by Bennett's extreme child-rearing methods (weeks alone in forest)
- **Bennett ↔ Anaba:** Views her academic approach as "giving speeches, talking too much"
- **Leadership Hierarchy:** All three report to the mysterious "Lady Luck" but operate largely independently

## Story Achievements

These achievements require completing each episode on **Challenge Mode**. This mode features stricter time limits, more resistant suspects, and less margin for error. **Note**: These are the ONLY achievements that require Challenge Mode.

### Tutorial & Episode Achievements

#### Taking Names and Asking Questions

- **Requirement**: Complete the police academy lesson.
- **Details**: This tutorial teaches basic interrogation mechanics. Cannot be missed.

#### Episode-Specific Achievements

1. **It's Always The Husband** - Complete Episode 1
    - **Strategy:** First, exhaust dialogue with the burglar, Jerry Cox, establishing he has no history of violence. Then, with the husband, Darrell Peterson, build empathy by agreeing with his 'tough guy' worldview. This leads him to reveal key information: his resentment for his wife ("she could be such a shrew"), his ownership of a gun, and his connection to the "Liberation Front."

2. **The Hornbunny Identity** - Complete Episode 2
    - **Strategy:** This is a timed interrogation. Cross-reference the nickname "Cat Lover 5" given by Fred Ennis with the other suspects. When they deny his existence, confront Fred. Use threats ("The last Liberation Front sympathizer... left with broken legs") to raise his fear and secure the password "Excelsior."

3. **Let's Go To The Mall. Today.** - Complete Episode 3
    - **Strategy:** Identify the security guard, Daniel Wilson, as the likely bomber. Build empathy by sympathizing with his military background ("Good work, soldier") and his financial struggles with his mother's medical bills. The critical dialogue path involves promising that his mother will be cared for, leading him to confess he was blackmailed.

4. **On the Subject of Delusions** - Complete Episode 4
    - **Strategy:** The key is manipulating the mentally unstable Alex Novak. Feed his paranoia by agreeing with his conspiracy theories ("the nanobots have reached your brain"). This breaks him, causing him to repeat phrases he was told, including the order to buy "nitromethane" from "Father Gabriel." Use this information to confront and break the priest, Gabriel Adams.

5. **The Veterinary Quandary** - Complete Episode 5
    - A hostage situation requiring negotiation and emotional manipulation.

6. **Broken People** - Complete Episode 6
    - Deep dive into Liberation Front recruitment and radicalization.

7. **Disarming Choices** - Complete Episode 7
    - **Strategy:** Discover that the factory owner, King, has a secret backdoor and his business is fully insured. After building empathy by aligning with his capitalist views, deceive him by pretending to be a high-ranking Liberation Front agent. Prove your credentials by 'tipping him off' about the pursuit of another agent, Ben Avis, to get him to disarm the bomb.
    - **Photo Puzzle:** Before interrogations, you must reassemble shredded surveillance photos showing a priest, woman, and another man. This physical evidence puzzle is required to proceed.
    - **Multiple Approaches:** Can also be solved through discovering King's insurance situation and using financial leverage rather than deception.

8. **Elias Hall's Keen Investigation** - Complete Episode 8
    - You are interrogated. Success requires defending your methods without admitting to illegal acts or sympathy for the Front.

9. **Now or Never** - Complete Episode 9
    - **Critical Choice:** You can only bring in two out of four suspects. **You MUST select either Anomaly (sociology professor) or Damascus Reed (entrepreneur)** to succeed. Other combinations will fail.
    - **Recommended Pairing:** Anomaly + Damascus Reed
    - **Strategy:** Build both empathy AND fear simultaneously. Need high empathy for trust, high fear for pressure.
    - **Information Gathering:** This episode provides crucial intelligence for Episode 10's betrayal strategy.
    - **Hint Sources:** Newspapers and mission conversations provide subtle guidance on correct suspect combinations.

10. **Decapitating Hydras** - Complete Episode 10
    - Final confrontation. Must get each leader to betray the others.

- **Narrative Impact**: The Liberation Front becomes a militant authoritarian organization.

#### 5. Cure For The Plague (Execution Ending)

- **Requirement**: Execute all three Liberation Front leaders.
- **How to Achieve**: This is the most complex ending. You must develop the "Messiah Complex" trait, recruit the 4th team member (Jonathan) and agree with extrajudicial killing, and build up your character's mental instability through excessive violence.

## Tips and Strategies

### General Gameplay Tips

1. **Understanding Cause and Effect**: Every action has consequences. Small dialogue choices accumulate to determine available options later.
2. **Interrogation Strategies**: Study suspect backgrounds carefully. Balance fear and openness. Failed interrogations often provide information for successful retries.
3. **Managing Multiple Meters**: It's nearly impossible to maintain perfect ratings. Decide early which reputation aspects matter for your playthrough.
4. **Efficient Achievement Hunting**: Use Challenge Mode for the first playthrough, then Narrative Mode for cleanup. Episode 2 is good for failure-related achievements.

### Key Deception & Manipulation Moments

Success in this game often hinges on specific moments of psychological manipulation. Here are detailed examples from successful playthroughs:

#### Episode 1: The Peterson Empathy-Building Sequence

**Objective:** Get murder confession from Darrell Peterson
**Strategy:** Build trust through ideological alignment, then exploit personal resentment

**Exact Dialogue Path:**

1. **Establish Connection:** "You seem like a tough guy. You're self-sufficient." (Raises empathy)
2. **Uncover Means:** "Do you plan on joining a group or something?" → Peterson reveals gun ownership
3. **Exploit Financial Stress:** "So your wife was the primary earner?" → Peterson admits resentment
4. **Align Ideologically:** "Vigilante justice, you think that's the solution?" → Peterson opens up about extremist views
5. **Final Push:** "There's many of us out there who think like this... the Liberation Front."

**Key Insight:** Peterson responds to being treated as an ideological ally rather than a suspect.

#### Episode 2: The Cross-Reference Deception

**Objective:** Identify Horn Bunny 49 and get password (7-minute timer)
**Strategy:** Use suspects' own lies against each other

**Exact Method:**

1. **Get False Information:** Ask Fred Ennis for his nickname → "Cat Lover 5"
2. **Cross-Reference:** Ask other suspects if they know "Cat Lover 5" → Both deny knowing this handle
3. **Confront with Evidence:** "We've asked around, Fred. There's no Cat Lover 5 in that chatroom."
4. **Apply Pressure:** "The last Liberation Front sympathizer we had here left with broken legs."
5. **Extract Password:** Fear level high → Fred cracks → "Excelsior"

**Key Insight:** Using suspects' own fabrications as leverage is more effective than external threats.

#### Episode 4: The Paranoia Amplification Technique

**Objective:** Break Alex Novak to get information about Father Gabriel
**Strategy:** Feed mental instability rather than providing stability

**Critical Dialogue Sequence:**

1. **Initial Paranoia:** "You've been on our radar for quite some time, Alex."
2. **Escalate Delusions:** "The nanobots have reached your brain by this point."
3. **Extract Programmed Information:** Alex's broken state causes him to repeat instructions verbatim
4. **Use Against Mastermind:** Confront Gabriel with Alex's testimony about "nitromethane"

**Key Insight:** With mentally unstable suspects, psychological pressure can cause them to reveal programmed information.

#### Episode 7: The Undercover Agent Deception

**Objective:** Get factory owner King to disarm bomb
**Strategy:** Complex multi-layered deception involving false identity

**Setup Phase:**

1. **Build Capitalist Rapport:** Agree with King's free-market ideology to raise empathy
2. **Discover Leverage:** Learn King's factory is fully insured against terrorist attacks
3. **Identify Backdoor:** Get King to admit he installed secret security access

**Deception Phase:**

1. **False Identity Claim:** "Our orders come from Lady Luck" (using high empathy)
2. **Prove Credentials:** Offer to sacrifice Ben Avis to demonstrate Liberation Front loyalty
3. **Operational Justification:** Frame bomb disarming as protecting other Liberation Front operations
4. **Success:** King disarms bomb believing he's helping the Front

**Key Insight:** High empathy enables complex deceptions that simple intimidation cannot achieve.

#### Episode 10: The Make-Believe Exercise Strategy

**Objective:** Get three leaders to betray each other
**Strategy:** Use ideological exercises to expose personal and political conflicts

**Three Core Exercises:**

1. **"Perfect Equity" (Marxist):** Appeals to Anaba Lee's collectivist views
2. **"Absolute Freedom" (Anarcho-Capitalist):** Appeals to Damascus Reed's libertarian ideology  
3. **"Burning Down the World" (Apocalyptic):** Appeals to Bennett's authoritarian survivalism

**Execution Method:**

1. **Start with Alignment:** Use exercise that matches suspect's ideology
2. **Build Trust:** Get them consulting on "theoretical" scenarios
3. **Switch to Opposition:** Use exercise representing opposing ideology
4. **Exploit Revealed Conflicts:** Use personal details (Reed/Anaba relationship, Bennett's child-rearing) as leverage
5. **Secure Betrayal:** Frame other leaders as threats to their vision

**Sample Personal Leverage:**

- **Anaba on Reed:** "Narcissistic know-it-all gazing disgusted at the rabble from his ivory tower"
- **Reed on Bennett:** Disgusted by Bennett's extreme survivalist training of his children
- **Bennett on Anaba:** "Giving speeches, talking too much, delegating irresponsibly"

### Thematic Dialogue and Character Voices

Pay close attention to how characters speak. The writing style is a deliberate clue to their background and vulnerabilities.

- **Street Slang:** Criminals like Jerry Cox use slang ("broseph," "ain't steal no bikes"), indicating a less formal background.
- **Ideological Jargon:** Educated leaders like Anaba Lee and Darrell Peterson use ideological language ("military-industrial complex," "the filth will drown us all"). Matching their language can build rapport.
- **Psychological Tics:** The mentally unstable Alex Novak speaks in cryptic, repeated phrases. Recognizing these as things he's been told by others is key to cracking his case.

### Detailed Character Vulnerabilities

- **Damascus Reed:** Libertarian entrepreneur, disgusted by Bennett's authoritarian methods
- **James Bennett:** Military authoritarian, views Anaba's ideology as weakness
- **Universal Strategy:** Exploit ideological differences and personal animosities simultaneously
- **Breaking Point:** Each believes the others will pervert their vision of the Liberation Front

### Ending-Specific Strategies

#### For Faction Endings (Anaba/Damascus/Bennett)

- Your entire playthrough matters, but Episodes 9-10 are most crucial
- Build ideological alignment through all dialogue choices
- In final interrogations, maximize empathy with your chosen leader
- Exploit ideological conflicts between leaders

#### For "Cure For The Plague"

- Start a fresh playthrough with this ending in mind
- Choose "Messiah Complex" trait when available
- Recruit Jonathan (4th team member) and agree with extrajudicial methods
- Build mental instability through excessive violence
- In final interrogations, use fear rather than empathy

### Time Management

- **Challenge Mode**: Timer decreases with each question asked
- **Narrative Mode**: More forgiving timers or no time pressure
- Plan your question path before starting timed interrogations
- Some red herring options waste valuable time
- Failing due to time allows you to retry with knowledge of dead ends

**Specific Episode Timers:**

- **Episode 2 (Horn Bunny 49):** 7 minutes total, 5 seconds lost per question asked
- **Episode 3 (Mall Bombing):** Variable timer based on bomb defusal urgency
- **Episode 5 (Hostage Situation):** 5 minutes before SWAT team intervention
- **Episode 6 (Factory Leaders):** Timer starts when bomb location is revealed
- **Episode 10:** Untimed - take as long as needed for complex manipulation

**Timer Management Tips:**

- **Episode 2:** Focus on cross-referencing nicknames rather than lengthy background questioning
- **Episode 3:** Prioritize suspects with clear motives (financial desperation) over ideological questioning  
- **Episode 5:** Use emotional leverage (family connections) rather than political debates
- **Timed Episodes:** Save complex psychological manipulation for untimed scenarios

**Strategic Time Usage:**

- First questions should establish basic facts and contradictions
- Middle questions build rapport or fear as needed
- Final questions should be direct confrontations or accusations
- Avoid "exploration" questions when timer is active

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Can I get all achievements in one playthrough?

A: No. At minimum, you need one Challenge Mode playthrough and additional playthroughs or save manipulation for all five endings and mutually exclusive achievements.

### Q: Do I need to use torture to complete the game?

A: No. The game can be completed without any "enhanced interrogation techniques." In fact, avoiding it is required for certain outcomes.

### Q: What's the difference between Challenge Mode and Narrative Mode?

A: Challenge Mode has stricter time limits and more resistant suspects. Narrative Mode is more forgiving and better for most achievement hunting.

### Q: Can I change my choices after making them?

A: You can restart failed interrogations. Between episodes, choices are permanent unless you load an earlier save. The Continue option after an ending only lets you replay the final interrogations.

### Q: How important are the team management sections?

A: Very important. They affect mission success, available options, multiple achievements, and public perception.

### Q: Which memories/traits should I choose?

A: This depends entirely on your intended playstyle and the ending you are aiming for. Choose traits that align with your strategy (e.g., Pacifist for empathy runs, Messiah Complex for the execution ending).

### Q: I can't unlock certain dialogue options in Episode 10. Why?

A: Dialogue options in the final interrogation depend on your ideological alignment throughout the game, information gathered in Episode 9, which memories/traits you've selected, and your relationship with each faction.

### Q: How do I know which suspect is guilty?

A: Look for inconsistencies in their stories, nervousness when discussing specific topics, background information that provides motive, connections to previously confirmed Liberation Front members, and physical evidence mentioned in reports.

### Q: Is there a "best" ending?

A: No. Each ending represents a different philosophical approach to extremism. The game intentionally avoids presenting any solution as definitively correct.

## Final Notes

"Interrogation: You Will Be Deceived" is a game that rewards careful thought, multiple playthroughs, and moral flexibility. While this guide provides the mechanical steps to achieve all endings and achievements, the true experience comes from grappling with the ethical dilemmas presented.

Remember that the game wants to open your mind rather than change it. Each playthrough can offer new insights into the characters, their motivations, and the complex web of ideology and violence that drives the narrative.

Whether you choose to be a by-the-book detective, a pragmatic operator willing to bend rules, or descend into becoming the very evil you fight against, the game ensures that every choice has weight and consequence.

Good luck, detective. The city is counting on you... but at what cost?
