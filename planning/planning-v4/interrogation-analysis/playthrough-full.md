## Video 1: Episode 1 - Darrell Peterson / Jerry Cox

[00:00:00] Hello, and in this video, I'll be playing through Episode 1 of *Interrogation: You Will Be Deceived*, illustrating how you can get a confession and win the episode hopefully without having to resort to any sort of intense interrogation. This is intended to help you if you're stuck, and I strongly suggest you stop the video once you feel you have what you need to finish the conversational puzzle on your own so that you don't ruin your experience of the game. There are many ways to finish an episode, and I will be showing you only one of them. So, try and discover your own.

[00:00:26] Let's start with the case before us. We are handling the murder of Ida Peterson, who was murdered in her living room in front of her husband, Darrell Peterson. This was allegedly done by Jerry Cox, a burglar who tried to enter that apartment.

[00:00:36] Our suspects are:

* **Jerry Cox:** A burglar with a long track record that includes car theft, pickpocketing, burglary, and credit fraud. The first thing that pops up here is that there are no violent crimes on his track record, so that's something to keep in mind.
* **Darrell Peterson:** The husband of the victim. We have him marked as a suspect mostly because when the police officers first arrived at the scene, they reported that Peterson was displaying unusual calm and composure, which is very strange for someone in his situation who has just witnessed what he witnessed.

[00:01:39] Let's bring them in. We have to think as a detective, and when we're talking about a murder, you have to think in terms of **motive**, **means**, and **opportunity**.

* **Motive:** We need a reason for any of these people to kill.
* **Means:** We need a method; in this case, we need a gun.
* **Opportunity:** We need an occasion for them to do this.

Both of them could have had the opportunity, so we need to focus on the motive and the means.

[00:01:54] When it comes to Jerry Cox, his motive could have been that he perhaps panicked when he tried to rob the house. So let's talk about the burglary with him and ask him if he was aware that there were people inside. He tells us that no, he didn't know if there were people there. Then he says he saw them, and he bolted back down the ladder before he could see anyone. Well, we know that's a lie because we know he stole something from that house, so we can confront him with that. He admits that he actually saw the bedroom was empty, and he jumped in. But when did he notice them? He noticed them after he jumped in, because he heard their voices inside the apartment somewhere, and it sounded like they were fighting.

[00:02:54] Did he hear what they were fighting about? He says that not really, he's "not with the CIA." So our motive is at a loss at this point because he claims he never even saw them.

[00:03:00] Let's try to work on the means. Let's see if he had a gun. He says that "someone must have dropped it or something," he doesn't know anything about the murder. But when we ask him, "How can we know that the gun is not here?", he is avoiding the conversation. Has he ever owned one? He says he never touches guns. Let's tell him, let's try to level with him, that it's not illegal to own a weapon. He's not in any sort of trouble; we just need to get to the bottom of this. He keeps to his story and says that he just doesn't do guns because they're trouble.

[00:04:10] So at this point, with Jerry Cox, we don't have a clear motive because he claims he just saw an empty house, jumped in, heard some voices, then ran away. In terms of means, we can't pin it on Jerry Cox because he claims he never owned a gun.

[00:04:18] Let's switch over to Darrell Peterson. What we want to do with Darrell Peterson is try to establish a connection with him, have him trust us. So we'll be trying to agree with him, slowly raising his trust with us, showing that we can understand his point of view, so that even if he's a troubled husband that has just been dragged into interrogation, we are here to help him.

[00:04:40] So let's talk about himself and her. Let's see how is he handling all of the loss? He says calmly that "we all have to move on." So that unusual composure, we see it now at play; people don't usually move on that fast. Let's try to raise our empathy with him, saying that we're doing the best we can to get the culprit behind bars, but we need his help. Calm as ever, Peterson tells us that he's here to help.

[00:05:10] But still, what he went through must have been traumatic. So let's try to check that: does he have any family or friends? He says not really, he is kind of a loner, and his folks died a long time ago. He's not really close to any relatives. So at this point, we have a choice here: we can either try an analysis of this person—look if he is more like a tough guy or if we should be a bit more sympathetic towards him, give him a shoulder to cry on, so to speak. Up to this point, he's been very calm, so we'll go for the first option: he seems like a tough guy. And indeed, our empathy with him rises because it seems to him that we're showing the kind of support he empathizes with.

[00:06:08] The last thing we want to do here is ask him if he wants to join a support group. He tells us, quite calmly (mostly because we have high empathy with him at this point), that the only group he's willing to join is the neighborhood watch. He's already part of that, and he hopes he can put that gun of his to some good use. So he slips out the fact that he's a gun owner, which is a very important aspect for our case. He also seems to have some very strong convictions when it comes to justice. Sure enough, we have this option here to ask him about it, and he tells us that he believes the world we live in needs a bit of a change. Let's keep agreeing with him, tell him that we're going to put that killer behind bars; he can trust us. Again, our empathy rises; we're certainly on the right path here.

[00:07:09] So up to this point, Peterson owns a gun, is strangely calm, is part of a neighborhood watch, and just can't wait to put that gun of his to good use. So we need to establish if he is the sort of person that would be able, psychologically and emotionally, to shoot someone. The last thing we want to do here is ask him if he took some leave from work to deal with this, just to see how truly calm he is. He says, "You know what? There's no need for that because he was fired."

[00:07:40] Why was he fired? He blames it on the big corporations, hiring cheap labor, a soulless lot, a lot of them. So that means his wife must have been the primary earner. He then admits to us, a bit frustrated, "Yes, that's the case. She was quite proud of it, and she rubbed it in his face with each opportunity she had." So there's some resentment there from Peterson towards his wife. This might be hinting at a possible motive: negative emotions between the two.

[00:08:10] Let's go back here, and we have two new options for conversation: we can talk about the gun he owns (although he's not a registered gun owner), and we can talk about his relationship with his wife. Let's go with the first. Let's talk about his gun. He says, "You know what? I don't need to register. The law says I don't have to register a gun." Let's not push him on this. Just ask him, "Why didn't you try to use your gun in self-defense?" Because we're trying to see if he would be able to shoot someone. He's saying that he was even waiting for an opportunity to test his aim on "filth like that." Interesting. Let's push a little bit more. He says that yes, he was actually prepared for this because "when justice isn't done by the system, you have to be prepared." Let's keep agreeing to keep our strategy, keep agreeing with him, raise his trust, raise his empathy. We'll tell him that we understand his concerns because most people wouldn't have the stomach to shoot. "Would you have been able to do so?" Sure enough, he says that yes. So he's the sort of person willing to shoot to kill, he claims.

[00:09:22] We can see we have another option here, discussing about his harsh views. Before we go into that, let's establish his relationship with his wife. So let's talk about his wife. He says that yes, they argued a lot. She was relentless about him getting fired; she mostly blamed him. He says that "women like her always think they know everything." A lot of frustration there. We know that Jerry told us that they were fighting the night the burglary happened. We can confront him, and he says that yes, they actually were fighting, and that it was a common thing for them.

[00:10:10] We've been slowly raising his trust with us, so let's see if he's really willing to open up and talk about his frustration. Sure enough, he says that yes, it was frustrating, and that at a certain point he just had enough. He's been with her for seven years; he expected some respect, some consideration. So at this point, we can ask him if he actually hated her. He says yes, he actually hated his wife. He's not happy that she died, but he feels some sort of relief. So we have a **motive** established: he hated his wife. We have **means** established: he owns a gun. And the last thing we need to see is to pin him on the record here that he is really the sort of person to shoot people.

[00:11:09] So let's talk about his harsh views. He proudly says that yes, he's the sort of guy to do what he'll actually justify as "president" on that. And because we've been agreeing with him up to this point, he thinks that we also are for harsh justice. So he tells us that "honest people like you and me need to take action on all the filth of the gutter." Okay, let's play the game with him, keep pretending like we agree. "Just two people won't change much," and he says that "there are many others out there, and that they find each other online, like-minded people willing to take up the responsibility and do the right thing."

[00:11:47] Okay, that's strange. Is he chatting with some sort of extremist people online? Let's ask some more about that. He explains to us what these people online do, what they talk about—the fact that they have a plan to change things, and that they talk in secret chat rooms that he doesn't have access to. Let's see why. He says that you need to show some commitment beforehand. Who has access then? He only gives us the name of "Horn 2049," his mentor. So it's clear that Darrell Peterson wasn't in a close circle of this extremist group that he's been talking with online. Let's ask him a bit more, and he gives us the name of this group: "The Liberation Front."

[00:12:50] So at this point, we know that Darrell Peterson hated his wife, owns a gun, is the sort of person to talk online in strange, shady chat rooms about vigilante justice and that sort of thing. He had the **opportunity** to do so because he could have used the burglary of Jerry Cox as a cover-up for the murder and tried to pin it on the burglar. So let's apply our last question, confront him. Let's tell him that we know you hated her, we know you argued, and we know about your extreme views. And with that, we have Darrell Peterson confessing. Thank you very much for watching.

## Video 2: Episode 2 - The Liberation Front (Horn Bunny 49)

[00:00:00] Hello, in this video I'll be playing through Episode 2 of *Interrogation: You Will Be Deceived*, illustrating how you can get a confession and win the episode hopefully without having to resort to any enhanced interrogation techniques. This is intended to help you if you're stuck, but I strongly suggest you stop the video once you feel you have what you need to finish the conversational puzzle on your own so that you don't ruin your experience of the game. There are many ways to finish an episode, and I will only be showing you one of them. So, try to get back in the game and discover your own.

[00:00:25] Let's look at the case before us. In this second episode, we've identified, through Peterson's tip from the last episode, that the Liberation Front, a very suspect group, is using a server that allegedly gives into a pet care website, and they're hiding in this particular chat room—a secret chat room that they're using to conduct their operations. All we have is an ID of someone who had access to this secret chat room: Horn Bunny 49. Using IP tracking, we've then identified three people who had access to the pet care chat room, and we have to assume that one of them is Horn Bunny 49 and has this password.

[00:01:00] So let's see who our three suspects are:

* **Diana O'Donnell:** She's an alternative model. She's been modeling, doing freelance work, occasional acting, and she hosts a blog that regularly critiques modern lifestyle trends. So she might be on many chat rooms just talking to people, getting their vibe so that she has something to post on her blog about, or, you know, she might have her extremist views.
* **Michael Lemon:** He works as a pet stylist, and he's an aficionado of the city's underground theater scene and a card-carrying member of the Democracy Party. So he's a very political person with alternative views.
* **Fred Ennis:** Frederick works as a risk analyst for a major bank. He's thrice divorced. He practices airsoft and plays tennis. That's all we know about him. We don't have much information on any of these people, but we do know that none of them had any sort of criminal track record, and all of them allegedly have some justifiable reason to be on the pet care chat room.

[00:02:10] So our strategy will be to either intimidate or try to raise their empathy with us enough so that they slowly open up and tell us about the Liberation Front. Let's bring them in. You will notice that this is a timed episode; we only have 7 minutes to finish this, because otherwise the password resets, and whatever we get from any of these people (if we get anything) we won't be able to use it anyway because the Liberation Front noticed our IP tracking scheme, and they're scrambling to change the password.

[00:02:46] Let's start. Every question we ask will spend five seconds of our time here, so we have to be very careful and considerate about what we ask. Let's take this step by step. The first thing we want to know is, we want to talk about the pet care chat room, and we have to discuss the nicknames. We want to know, "Do you know this Horn Bunny?" Diana says she doesn't really know, but she begins to say something but then changes her mind. So she might be holding something back. Let's try to see what nickname she uses. She doesn't really want to say. Makes sense, we just dragged her here, remember? Asking her creepy questions about the pet care chat room online. Makes sense she's holding back.

[00:03:26] Let's, without going back or anything, switch to Michael Lemon over here. Going into the same conversation, talk about nicknames: "Does he know Horn Bunny?" He says that he's seen them about, but he doesn't know them. "Maybe because of what nickname you use?" He says he doesn't remember, but he's also avoiding the conversation. Okay, this is the same with Fred. Let's talk about the pet care chat room, talk about the nicknames. Ask him what nicknames that he uses. He tells us: "It's Cat Lover 5." So finally, we have someone that's willing to talk with us. "Does he know who Horn Bunny 49 is?" He says, quite stiffly, "No, he's never seen them around."

[00:04:13] Now we have an option to either try to intimidate him, to raise his fear of us, or try to raise his empathy with us. I will try to raise his fear with us this playthrough, so I'm going to threaten him that if he lies to me one more time, things will get rough. I have no intention of roughing him up, but he doesn't know that. So he pulls back slightly in his chair, but he says that he doesn't know. Okay, but his fear of me has raised.

[00:04:40] Let's move back to talk with these other people because Fred Ennis told us that his nickname is Cat Lover 5. Let's see if someone else knows about Cat Lover 5. Sure enough, here's the option. So Michael Lemon over here says he knows the chat room pretty well, but he's pretty sure he never saw anyone with that handle. How about Diana? Does she know Cat Lover 5? She doesn't think so.

[00:05:09] So let's move back to Fred. So, Fred, "What nickname did you say you use? It's Cat Lover 5." Okay, so you claim you don't know who this Horn Bunny 49 is. He shakes his head, says he doesn't know. We should stop pestering. But here we have a new option that has unlocked. We know there's no Cat Lover 5 because we've asked two other people who are quite present in that chat room, and they've never heard of Cat Lover 5. So we can confront him with that. Fred pipes up, "I'm Horn Bunny 49, okay?" The fact that he's scared and she looks shocked and troubled, that's interesting, right? But we can't arrest him for that. So let's try to continue our conversation. Let's see why he hid it. "Just didn't think it'd matter because it's [__]." Okay.

[00:06:17] Let's see if he's willing to open up about the special room. He says he doesn't know anything about a "special room." So, at this point, we have to raise his fear. Let's press him until he tells us about it, or raise his fear. Since we've used fear up to this point, I'm going to stick with that strategy. Let's move back a bit here. We have to find some ways to intimidate or raise his fear, but we're looking to scare him. So let's talk about the Liberation Front, and he says that he sees their point. So he knows about the Liberation Front. All right, and he agrees with some of their points. He looks away, so he might be a bit ashamed to talk about this.

[00:07:03] We're trying to scare him, so let's be blunt. Let's scare him. We're going to tell him, "The last Liberation Front sympathizer we had here left with broken legs." He is visibly nervous. We're trying to deduce if the Liberation Front is an actual threat. Fair enough to ask if we think the Liberation Front is willing to take violent action. He seems quite shocked by that. He says, "No, not like that." Let's look, what else can we do? We have tested how he'd do it, but what if *we* do it? He just says he wants his lawyer, right? So his fear is pretty high at this point.

[00:07:54] Let's move back, roll back here. He admits, "I'm Horn Bunny 49," but let's try to push him one last time. Maybe us telling him that we break the legs of Liberation Front sympathizers is enough. And yes, it is. He breaks; he speaks fast. He says, "Yes, yes, I know. So what? It's just a private chat room." And he's scared. "It's not illegal to be a key, that's it!" Let's just double check. He admits, "Yes, I know."

[00:08:26] Let's move back through the conversation. And now we have a new option. Since we know he has access to this special room, we can try to find out more about what's going on in there. Who has access? We know Darrell Peterson didn't have access, so this is a way to check if he's lying. He tells us that they didn't use real names, he might have for all he knows. So, I think the truth about this one is, "Is the special room actually from the Liberation Front?" This is to confirm our theory. And yes, he confirms it. He says that yes, it is. But again, that's not something we can put him in jail for. He says we have no proof. So him telling us that we have no proof makes me think that he believes he is actually guilty of something else. What could we have proof of, right?

[00:09:09] So, "Why the need for such privacy?" He seems very uncomfortable. He doesn't think he needs any justification for this. So at this point, I think we got Fred very nervous. He's a really regular guy; he's a risk analyst. He just might be in the wrong place at the wrong time. He says, "I've sworn an unforgivable..." While we've been scaring him all this time, let's press him one last time. He cracks. He says, "It's just 'Traffic.' That was the password." And that's the end of the episode. Thank you very much for watching.

## Video 3: Episode 3 - The Mall Bombing

[00:00:00] Hello, in this video I'll be playing through Episode 3 of *Interrogation: You Will Be Deceived*, illustrating how you can get a confession and win the episode hopefully without having to resort to any sort of enhanced interrogation techniques. This is intended to help you if you're stuck, but I strongly suggest you stop the video once you feel you have what you need to finish the conversational puzzle on your own so that you don't ruin your experience of the game. There are many ways to finish an episode; I will only be showing you one of them, so try to get back in the game and discover your own.

[00:00:25] Let's look at the case before us. In Episode 3, we're dealing with the aftermath of Episode 2. So we found out the password to a special room that the Liberation Front was using to coordinate their actions. And there we discovered that the Liberation Front is actually planning a terrorist attack by planting a bomb in the city mall. We know from looking at the chat room that their agent, after planting the bomb, was supposed to be at a specific location in the mall to confirm the exact place, the correct placement, and the successful placement of the bomb. The only problem is, when we got to that specific location, we actually found three people, and two of them were actually in a fight.

[00:00:59] We had our first suspect, **Daniel Wilson**, a security guard at the mall. He frequently visits Christian conservative websites and is an active supporter of gun rights, firmly opposes political correctness. He was just detaining **Vakeel Madan**. And Vakeel Madan had a gun in his possession. So these two are in a scuffle when we arrived the scene. Also with them, Daniel Wilson was seen talking before the scuffle between Vakeel and Daniel began. Daniel was seen talking to **Samantha Lau**. She's an interior decorator and animal rights activist. She's engaged to be wed in a month—how nice, congratulations!

[00:01:51] So these three people are the ones that we have to deal with, and one of these three is a terrorist who planted a bomb. So let's see how we can do this. Let's bring them in, and we see that we have only a limited time to do this, because if we check our files and we look at the case file, we see that experts estimated the location of the bomb must be extracted within minutes, or the bomb squad won't be able to disable the device. So we're on a timer here because that bomb is going to blow if we don't get any of these people to tell us where it is. My strategy for this play-through will be to try to raise their empathy stat with me, because I assume that any terrorist willing to plant a bomb will not be cracking under fear if he knows that bomb has been correctly set and is set to blow; he has nothing to lose at this point. So I'll be trying to raise his empathy.

[00:02:46] Let's start with the only person that actually did something illegal at the time, which is Vakeel; he had a gun. Let's see why did he run away? He plainly admits he had an illegal gun for his own protection, tucked away. "What are you doing at the mall with a gun?" He says he got it for self-defense; he lives in a very dangerous neighborhood. Let's again go by our strategy, try to raise our empathy. We say that we won't charge him, and our empathy rates. Okay, let's check his file. Is he from the city? He says he lives in the slums, where it's cheap, so he is clearly not very well-off. "Does he have any family?" "None in this country." "How about back home?" He just informs us his uncle works in the department store. Okay, we can ask him a very direct question: "Any terroristic involvement?" He states without hesitation, "No, of course not."

[00:03:57] So at this point, we see that Vakeel is a poor man, an immigrant trying to help his family back home. He does have an illegal gun on him; he claims it's for his own protection. Let's see what he thinks about the Liberation Front. We ask him if he's been in contact with them. He says, "No, of course not." "What do you think of them?" He says, "They are what happens when the culture's dreams become a nightmare." Okay, that's quite philosophical. We're not really getting anywhere with him.

[00:04:30] Okay, so let's try to get the other side of the story. Let's talk with Daniel. Talk about the man he apprehended. First of all, let's see what Daniel thought was suspicious. Daniel just says he was "being shifty," just that "look in his eyes." He asks us if we ever act on instinct. We're trying to raise our empathy with all our suspects, so we're going to agree and say that we follow our instinct all the time, and he was very happy to hear that. Let's ask him why he acted on his own. He says his training kicked in. Remember, Daniel is a former Marine. Okay, so he's a former soldier, that's what his file says. So this confirms that. We can ask him, you know, try to put pressure on him, "Maybe he's just racist for going after an immigrant?" Or we can say, "Good work, soldier, he had a bad day." We're trying to raise our empathy, so that's where we're going to go from. He nods and says, "Thank you."

[00:05:27] So at this point, he doesn't really have a reason for attacking Vakeel. Maybe it was just luck that Vakeel had an actual gun, and Daniel didn't really give us a reason. Okay, let's see if Daniel understands his situation. He's assuming it's about the guy he put down at the mall. Well, that's not exactly correct. Let's not tell him straight up what we're here for. Let's tell him it's an investigation with much bigger stakes and that it's classified, but his info might be crucial. He believes we're some sort of spec ops team, and he seems quite excited to be working with us.

[00:05:58] Okay, let's try to find out more about Daniel since we weren't getting anywhere. Let's see if he's from the city. He says he's born and raised; he loves this place. Okay, so he's a patriot. Where is he employed? We know he's employed as a security guard, so he confirms that. Excellent, he's not lying to us. Let's see if he was working at the shop in front of where the incident happened. Remember, we're trying to identify why were these people at that specific place that the Liberation Front chatroom mentioned, so all of them must have a proper explanation for that. Let's see what Daniel says. He doesn't have one; he was just passing by there. He's actually posted two floors down. Okay, that's interesting.

[00:06:37] Let's talk about his soldier past. He said he used to be with the Marine Corps. And here we see a very interesting, tricky question: "Did he work with explosives during his time in the military?" He admits, "Grenades, C4, all sorts." So we can interpret this in two ways: he's already very honest with us, because of course any soldier would work with that. If he would have lied, then it's clear he has something to hide. But just the fact that he's telling us the truth about his experience with grenades and C4 doesn't exonerate him from being a terrorist; he still has that explosive knowledge; he still could have used that.

[00:07:13] Let's see why he became a soldier. He says it's about duty to protect this great country and the things in it. So he seems very patriotic. Let's try to raise our empathy with him. He says that yes, of course, duty extends to anyone affected by a potential terrorist plot, and our empathy raises. Cool. "Why isn't he on active duty?" He says that he has to come home, but doesn't tell us why. Interesting. He has changed the subject.

[00:07:50] Let's try to find out why isn't he here, why did he have to come back? "Is he family?" He says the only family he has is his mom. She's probably worried about him. "Does he live with his mom?" He says she does because he's taking care of her because she's sick. Well, the medical bills must be very expensive, and he says that yes, it adds up. He states with sadness in his voice. This is because our empathy with him is very open to talk about his background, his patriotism. We have agreed with him, so he's a bit willing to open up and tell us about his troubles. Let's ask him how hard it is to conquer the bills. He says it's quite hard. So Daniel is in a lot of trouble. He seems like a good guy; he's taking care of his mother. He's a former soldier, a patriot, but he has economic problems; he doesn't have a lot of money to take care of his ill mother.

[00:08:44] So let's empathize with him. Let's tell him that it's always a shame when the innocents suffer. Maybe this makes him, if he's the terrorist, this will make him feel that. He says, "It just ain't fair when bad things happen to random people." Okay, so our empathy with Daniel at this point is pretty high, so he will be willing to open up with us. And if we press this question right here, we can see that he loves "this town." And he just admits that he was forced. We have this option here because we talked about his mother; we know that this might be about his mother. The Liberation Front might have been keeping her hostage, or they might have threatened Daniel, or maybe they're just paying him. But we can make sure, we can promise Daniel that she is going to be taken care of. And sure enough, Daniel, he's a good guy, he's a soldier, he's a patriot. He doesn't want to do this. He just tells us that the explosives are on the fifth floor, and that's that. Thank you very much for watching.

## Video 4: Episode 4 - The Office Building Bombing

[00:00:00] Hello, in this video I'll be playing through Episode 4 of *Interrogation: You Will Be Deceived*, illustrating how you can get a confession and win the episode hopefully without having to resort to any enhanced interrogation techniques. This is intended to help you if you're stuck, and I strongly suggest you stop the video once you feel you have what you need to finish the conversational puzzle on your own so that you don't ruin your experience of the game. There are many ways to finish an episode, and I will only be showing you one of them. So, try and discover your own.

[00:00:22] Let's start with the case before us. In Episode 4, we have to deal with the aftermath of a string of explosions that happened throughout the city that we were not able to track and defuse in time. We defused one of the bombs, but more of them blew up in the city. One of these bombs was placed in an office building; more specifically, through forensic evidence, we deduced that it was placed on the 13th floor of the building. Also, by looking at the video footage of a surveillance camera in one of the elevators, we found that only three people actually stopped on the 13th floor of that building, which was actually closed down for renovations. So these people shouldn't have been there since the floor was out of use, but these are the only three people that actually stopped there.

[00:01:06] So let's see who they are:

* **Maya Clarke:** She's an employee in that building. She has no criminal record, and her performance reports show she's a hardworking, committed employee.
* **Alex Novak:** He is a man that we couldn't find too much about. We know he had several name changes throughout the years, and that his recent medical records state he's possibly suffering from a form of schizophrenia. He's been receiving care and medication from Humanitas, a charity founded by Gabriel Adams.
* **Gabriel Adams:** This man is a well-known and respected local priest that has been preaching in the city for the last few years. He leads Humanitas, a Christian charity focusing on helping people with disabilities or special needs. And very interestingly, Humanitas has actually had so much success in recent years through donations that they actually rented the 13th floor, and they were supposed to have their headquarters there, so presumably that's why it was under renovations.

[00:02:16] So all of these people had unrestricted access to the building and then to that floor, and all of them stopped on that floor at the same time. So the first thing we're going to do is we're going to try to understand why these people are there.

[00:02:33] Let's introduce ourselves to Miss Clarke, and we're going to try to intimidate her into telling us more. She says it was "quite a tragedy"; she doesn't know what happened. But let's see, "Why were you there?" We have video footage of you stopping there, and that makes you a main suspect. She seems very scared, very distraught by that, and angered. Let's ask, "What happened there? Why did you go there?" She says it's "always free, barely anyone there." Okay, but what did you do there? She said she went there to smoke. So she seems to be telling us that she goes often to the 13th floor because it's calming, quiet, and someplace where she can get a smoke. Cool.

[00:03:19] Let's check with Gabriel Adams. Let's introduce ourselves. Let's tell him that he's a "murdering terrorist." It raises our fear with him, and he tells us that he came here without a lawyer; he's just here to help, and we should drop that tone. We're going to do just that after we tell him that he's a main suspect and that we want to know why he stopped there. He says he was there to inspect renovations on that floor. That's a good reason; nothing strange there. "What did you do?" He says he checked the status of the renovations. So his story is very consistent.

[00:03:52] And if we go to Alex, again, scare him as well. Here we have an interesting option. We can tell him that he'll be out of here in no time, trying to calm him down. Or, we could take the middle ground, saying his input will be useful in our investigation. Or, we could try to mock him, or anger him. Let's do that; he doesn't seem angry at this point. Let's see what Alex has to say about the fact that we have video footage. He says quite strangely that he's glad the "drones" are still working. Here's our first strategic option: we can try to calm him down, or we can try to push him in his paranoia. I remember his file says he is psychologically unstable, so we're going to use that against him by trying to intimidate, scare, and push his paranoia as much as we can. So we're going to say, "Yes, he's been on my radar." He panics a bit before calming down. So we want to know, "Why did he stop there?" Sure enough, he seems to have been accompanying Father Gabriel. Let's see, "What did you do there?" "Not much." Okay.

[00:05:07] So at this point, we want to destabilize this guy. This guy is our main target because we know he's psychologically unstable; we might be able to squeeze something out of him. Let's ask him about the explosion. Let's ask him, "Where were you when the explosion happened?" He says he was in a car, at a safe distance when it happened. "Why would someone have targeted that specific building?" He gives us a straight answer. He says, "Because of poor structural design." Again, let's try to push him on this. Again, we can calm him down, say it was just a random act of violence, no conspiracy, or deepen his paranoia. Let's do just that. He tells us that it "had to be someone with axes, motive, and possibly delusions of power, and someone should really get a team to investigate us." Thank you very much, Alex; that's some great advice right there. You see his pulse is kind of spiking at this point; we've been pushing his paranoia.

[00:06:13] Let's try to get some more emotional leverage on him. See if he knew anyone that got hurt. He again, his theory is that there's a conspiracy here, and he claims that "they missed him this time, a coordination on their part, whoever they are." So clearly, he believes he was the target. "Why is that?" He says he's "sure they were after him." "Really? Why would anyone want you dead?" He doesn't really know. "Why would anyone want Father Gabriel dead?" He doesn't really know. Again, we have an option here. Let's push his paranoia even further. "We think he's onto something." And now he seems scared; he's swearing, saying, "We have to do something!" So at this point, he's kind of scared, right? We can push him, but he's not there yet.

[00:07:11] Let's see what he knows about the Liberation Front. He says he doesn't know who that is. But look at that look he gave us; he's clearly hiding something. And we want to push him even more so that he admits who they are. We say, "It's just a bunch of terrorists that need to be brought to justice." And he says, "Until they blow up." So he's scared of the Liberation Front. Okay, he's kind of worried about them, and he's worried they might be after him. Okay, so let's see what he thinks about violence. Doesn't want to think about that. So perhaps he's pushing away some of these failed feelings. Let's try to trigger him by pushing him into a confession. He hasn't been giving us much; he's been giving us evasive answers. Let's see if we can push him. And sure enough, here it is: he lowers his gaze, twitches. He tells us that "emotions are the devil's gateway. Lock up your emotions. Chain your demons, Alex." So this is something someone told him that he is now repeating to us. And because we've pushed his paranoia so far, we can now nail the final nail in the coffin and tell him that "it's the nanobots; they've rigged his brain." And now he's just gone; he's bonkers; he's spewing random gibberish.

[00:08:42] But now you're going to notice here, we have the same questions as before, but if we try to ask him something, he just gives us strange answers, right? But from all these answers, we might be able to get something useful, right? So if we ask him about the 13th floor, he says, "It's now a graveyard for those that could not be saved." Let's see what he means by that. He says, "We're born in sin, Alex." Someone again told him this: "Born in sin." "Why do you think we don't deserve to be saved?" "We deserve nothing." Again, this is probably something someone told him. "How could you have tried harder to save them, Alex?" "Smile, smile, and show them how strong you are." Okay, let's see what more we can get by talking about him, about the explosion. He says, "The walls have eyes." So clearly his paranoia is through the roof. "Where were you?" And he says, "Let's go home." Okay, so he was with, he's linking the explosion with someone telling him to "go home." No malice intended.

[00:09:55] So let's go back to that "poor structural design" thing, and he gives us a very weird answer, whispering, he says, "We do what we must because we choose to." Interesting. "Why did he choose to do it?" And he again, with that weird, twitchy manner of speaking, he tells us, "The man should give you three gallons. Make sure it says 'Nitromethane' on them. Bring them over, but don't shake them too hard." So again, he's repeating something he heard, some things someone said to him. And for those of you who don't know, nitromethane is a very common ingredient in bombs.

[00:10:39] So at this point, we have Alex Novak on tape mentioning bomb ingredients, but also implying somehow that someone told him this. So what we need is to find out who told him that, right? So let's ask him, "Where did you get your idea from?" "Father Gabriel told me I could choose to be strong, but also that God has a place for me in this world." So at this point, we can be quite certain that Gabriel Adams has been spewing religious extremism to Alex Novak through Humanitas. Alex seems to have been helped by Humanitas, but he's been exposed to all these things and possibly sent to buy actual bomb ingredients.

[00:11:21] Let's see what more he has for us. Let's talk about the Liberation Front. "What do you think about them? How do you feel about their aggressive agenda?" And here he says that, "I think you will... if you believe in something, something good, you should do everything for it." Let's push him, "Even hurting people?" And Alex says that, "No, no." So he's not a violent person; even in this state, he's against violence. So someone must have pushed him to buy that; clearly, it wasn't his idea. And when we asked him about the Liberation Front's goals, he links the Liberation Front with what Father Gabriel told him about this new flood that will be "God's will." Interesting. "Is Alex a member of the Front?" And he says he's "not ready to become a full member of Humanitas." Again, he's linking the Liberation Front to Humanitas. Interesting. So at this point, even if we push him further, he's not going to tell us any more. But he gave us plenty to work with while we tried to break the actual mastermind that was using Novak in all of this.

[00:12:35] So let's go back. Let's not leave the dispatch. Let's first get him more scared. Let's ask some personal questions. Let's talk about religion, since Alex mentioned so many religious things. Let's talk about religion with him. Let's see what he thinks about this new biblical flood that Alex mentioned. He turns the question back on us. We're not going to fall into his religious trap; we're not going to show any sympathy towards that. So what does he mean about this flood? Again, keep in mind what we're doing here is we're getting him to say, to repeat his ideology, as extremist as Alex told us, that on tape. So we can use that against him. He tells us that the signs of the flood are there, and he tells us that he wants a virtuous world of peace and love and that our children will build this promised land. Okay, so he wants this new biblical flood to happen.

[00:13:42] What we need now is to link him in some way to the actual explosives, as we have. Again, if we think in terms of motive, means, and opportunity, his motive could be this religiously motivated "new flood." We need a means; we need him linked to the bomb. Alex mentioned nitromethane, and instantly he scrambles to give us an explanation. He asks if he "really elegantly told us that," "Oh, yeah, he told us many, many things." And he started this way. Let's see, "Why does he need this?" He says it's "fuel for making planes," "commercially available," "of course, modern airplanes." "Why did you send Alex?" He says he "doesn't remember," he "might have done some 'dice.'" Okay. "Should I ask Alex anything else?" And he says, "Don't stress the boy." Look at this priest's face, right? He's scared. Let's challenge him. And at this point, we know that we have him on record claiming the apocalypse is coming, as well as holding other extremist views. We can say that to him. He sort of replies, "No, it's just a new flood." And we have Alex telling us about the nitromethane. So in this instance, we had Alex that was not... it's up to you to decide how guilty Alex was, but he was more rather used by Gabriel Adams. And the priest knows it's over; we have too much on tape at this point, and he tells us that we are "dealing with an agent of Satan," but he confesses. So, thank you very much for watching.

## Video 5: Episode 5 - The Vet Clinic Hostage Situation

[00:00:00] Hello, in this video I'll be playing through Episode 5 of *Interrogation: You Will Be Deceived*, illustrating how you can get a confession and win the episode hopefully without having to resort to any enhanced interrogation techniques. This video is intended to help you if you're stuck, but I strongly suggest you stop the video once you feel you have what you need to finish the conversational puzzle on your own so that you don't ruin your experience of the game. There are many different ways to finish an episode, and I will only be showing you one of them, so try to get back to the game and discover your own path.

[00:00:27] Let's start with the case before us. In Episode 5, we have to deal with something different: we have to deal with a hostage situation. We have Cassandra Higgs and Lucas Romano, two suspects that are linked to the string of explosions that the Liberation Front has caused throughout the city. When the officers approached these suspects, they jumped into a car, and after a car chase, they took some hostages in a vet clinic.

[00:01:01] So let's see who they are:

* **Cassandra Higgs:** She's currently employed at a company that offers consultation and logistical support to various labor unions. She's a graduate from a city university with a Master's degree in Political Sciences. She volunteers for an NGO, and through her online social profiles, we have identified Amatis Garcia as a romantic interest. We've also reached out to him, so we can expect him to arrive sometime soon. So she seems to be a well-educated, politically involved individual. She volunteers in soup kitchens that provide education for children in difficult social situations. So on the surface, she seems to be a very nice person. Who knows what the Liberation Front told her that made her turn to this sort of extreme thing.
* **Lucas Romano:** Another young student at the City University. He's been expelled several times after harassment, loitering, and trespassing charges, which resulted from Romano and a few others trying to disrupt events at some local politicians. So again, we have a very politically active and politically involved individual who's not afraid to take action.
* **Amatis Garcia:** All we know about him is that he is the life partner of Cassandra Higgs, and we only know this from their online social profiles. We've brought him in for questioning; he should be arriving soon.

[00:02:29] So let's bring them in. Couple of things you're going to notice: first of all, there's no suspect in front of us; there's just the phone. We're talking to Cassandra Higgs through this phone; the conversation is being recorded. Our objective here is not to extract any sort of confession—it's obvious she's a criminal, right? We just need to negotiate the safe release of the hostages and have Cassandra turn herself in, hopefully.

[00:02:59] So from the beginning, we have to pick our strategy: will we try to scare her into surrendering, or will we try to slowly build up trust and a relationship between us and Cassandra so that she slowly, we win her over and convince her that this is not the way to go? In this playthrough, I'm going to go with the empathy option, so let's try to do it that way.

[00:03:37] Let's tell her that we want to make sure nobody dies, and she just [__] off, telling us, "You don't have any interest in Lucas or me dying." You see, we have a timer; you only have five minutes before something really bad happens, or in this case, before the SWAT team is sent in. And once the SWAT team is sent in, we cannot assure the safety of the hostages, so the game assumes a failed state. So we need to have Cassandra turn herself in before the SWAT team has to go in, right? So let's keep with our empathy approach. We need to make sure that she doesn't believe we're the enemy here. She needs to believe we're on her side, so we just want to make sure that everybody is safe, right? Cool.

[00:04:28] So this is what we're looking at: we need to raise the empathy. Keep in mind, at a certain point, Amatis will also be coming, so after some time passes, Amatis will appear here, and we'll be able to talk with him. Until then, another thing you can notice is that we have three red questions. One of them is for Cassandra to turn herself in, one of them is for the release of the hostages, and one of them is for getting us more time. In order for all of these things to be available to us, we need to either raise our empathy or our fear with Cassandra, right? So let's take these in a logical sense. It seems that the Liberation Front encouraged her to take these violent actions.

[00:05:26] Let's talk about the Liberation Front. She accuses us of not knowing the Front. Let's prove her otherwise, that we know that this is not in line with the Front's objectives. Again, she disputes our knowledge of that fact. Let's just hear her, tell her that, "You know, whatever, just make them look like the bad guys at this point." And she says, "We don't want to be liked; we want to change the world." "How?" I replied. "But this is not what the Front believes in." Again, she disputes; "we can't possibly know what the Front believes in." We can either scare her, telling her that the Front won't have her back because she took chances, or telling her that she's undermining the message of the people's revolution. Let's scare her. She just tells us to [__] off. But we can see here, through her voice, the empathy level is raising. She's starting to believe we might know a thing or two about the Front.

[00:06:26] Let's tell her there's a better way to do this. She mocks us. We can scare her, telling her the Front will see her as a liability, or tell her that even if she's in prison, she can pursue social change peacefully behind bars. She dismisses us again, but the empathy bar is raised. Let's go back here. So we've talked to her about the Liberation Front, showing her we understand a thing or two about it. Let's try to get more time at this point. We have four options here, some of them make more sense than others. Let's tell her that, you know, "No sane pilot is willing to escort a violent terrorist out of the country," right? So let's tell her that. And sure enough, that makes sense. Cassandra tells us that, you know, we can have a bit more time. She gives us three more minutes. That's very good.

[00:07:18] Now let's try to tell Cassandra that we know about her as well. We've read her file, so we know she's an intelligent woman and that she's not a terrorist. And we know she helps girls in marginalized communities. Or we can just tell her she's a "real soul." Let's try to speak to her emotional side. These are more options for us here. We just wanted to show her we understand her, and we don't want her to get harmed, and we just want people to be safe, right? So let's just go. And you can see here now that Amatis Garcia has arrived. Let's switch over to him. "Thank you for coming."

[00:07:56] Our objective with Garcia here is to use him in some way as emotional leverage against Cassandra. So let's see if he's involved in the Front. He tells us, "No, absolutely not." "Maybe they forced you?" "Not really." But he doesn't know if that's what they did with Cassandra. So let's explore this with him. Let's see how much Amatis knows about Cassandra's involvement. He says he had no idea. "Did you never talk about the Front with her?" He says that she might have mentioned it, but he thinks it was just talk. We can try to play some jealousy cards with him, but let's try not to do that. Let's just try to calm him down, see if he can give us something to maybe calm Cassandra. Let's talk about Cassandra's political views. And again, let's calm Amatis down. "It's not your fault, man, it's not your fault if you did this." Okay. "But didn't you notice she was spending time with anyone suspicious?" He says Cassandra hangs out with Stalinist communists and other fringe groups, all sorts of political extremists and social activists of all kinds. So he never saw anything strange. Just because she was not hanging out with the Liberation Front. But maybe Amatis holds any of them responsible, and he puts the blame on the Front, not on Cassandra. Fair enough.

[00:09:53] Let's talk about the deals with the Liberation Front. Once again, let's see if he knows anything else about her extreme political views. He doesn't know anything. So at this point, we know that Amatis and Cassandra didn't really talk about the Liberation Front, so Cassandra was keeping him out of this Liberation Front business. Now we can exploit that if we talk about their relationship, right? We can maybe try to antagonize them, antagonize Amatis against Cassandra, or maybe have Amatis reinforce his relationship with Cassandra so that she knows if she surrenders, Amatis would be here. That might be something useful. So let's see if those two were happy. He thinks, "Yeah, very much so." Let's see if she was emotionally available to him. Amatis says he kind of misses Cassandra lately; she's been spending a lot of time with these terrorists. "This must be a bit of a difficult time." But because we calmed Amatis down and told him it's not his fault, it's not Cassandra's fault, and we shifted the blame towards the Liberation Front, he does say he loves her and that he is a bit hurt by this because so much was hidden from him.

[00:11:18] Let's move back to Cassandra. Again, you see a new option here that popped up: "I have someone new here that you can talk about." And we have a message here. First of all, she tells us, "Listen, just don't get it." Well, we're sure about it. We can have these conversations, but we can tell her, "He's very worried," which is kind of obvious. Obviously, we can tell her that Amatis told us he feels hurt because so much of Cassandra's real life was kept away. She's very sorry about that. Then finally, let's tell her again. She cracked; she's holding back a sob. The empathy level is rising. Cassandra's starting to believe maybe, maybe even if she surrenders at this point...

[00:12:12] Let's try to ask for more time. And looking at all these options, perhaps we can tell her, "It's hard for us to get some money." And she tells us that "these [**] pieces of [**] should stop pretending that they give a [__] about the citizens and should give her the money." But she gives us a bit more time.

[00:12:43] At this point, I think it's fair to try to either pull out one or both of the hostages, or try to talk with the other guy, right? We have two people in there: we have Cassandra and Lucas Romano, both of them Liberation Front members. Let's talk to Mr. Romano. She just tells us, "No." Let's ask again. She just really doesn't want us talking to him. I don't know why. Maybe she's afraid we might be able to persuade him. We're very persuasive people. Let's try to take one of the hostages. Let's see how they're doing in there. She tells us they're fine, and they will remain fine. So she doesn't seem to want to harm them at this point. Then, looking at her background, I believe that... Okay, we could ask for both hostages or just one. Let's go for the more gradual option and just ask for one. That way, she still has something, some sort of backup. She knows we won't gun her down as long as, or she assumes we won't gun her down as long as she still has a hostage. So she's willing to give us one.

[00:13:54] So now one of the hostages is on the way; she's being brought in here. But until then, we have a bit more time. Let's try to talk with the same. Let's see if she needs anything in there. We can ask, "Food? Blankets? Anything to be transmitted to your families?" Or any soft choice of words? Or pictures? Obviously, this is just to make them afraid. Let's see, maybe "to their families?" She doesn't like that; she just wants our families out. Okay. Let's see what else we could talk about. We've been through all this. Let's see if anything new popped up. Nothing really here. She doesn't want to talk about herself, or she doesn't want to give us Mr. Romano to put him on the phone. She doesn't want anything in there. Let's see if we can break her with her boyfriend. Not really. So at this point, we've exhausted most of our options. Maybe it's time to have her turn herself in.

[00:15:15] Let's tell her, "This won't change the system." Hmm, she's not very convinced about that. Okay, maybe she wants to join her Mr. Romano. She's not putting him on the phone, and she's like, "Sure, fine, if that's what will get me out of here." She'll give us Romano. So Romano is now out, on his way here. Clearly, Cassandra and Romano weren't that close; otherwise, she wouldn't have just sent him out. But now we see Sylvia Logan, one of the hostages, is here, and she has a blanket. She's clearly terrified. So our objective here, you see, she starts with a high level of fear; we need to calm her down, right? We could tell her that her colleague is in danger, but I don't think that will calm her down. Let's just ask her if she's okay. Here, we have a long list of things we can say to either scare her or calm her down. Let's try to comfort her. We won't tell her it's a miracle she made it out; instead, we'll ask:

[00:16:31] "Has your family been contacted? What's going on in there?" And she tells us that Cassandra and Lucas seemed very agitated and scared. The woman seemed to be in charge. They were just sort of nervous. Okay, so that confirms everything we know about them so far. They don't seem to be reckless criminals or cold-blooded criminals; they're just misguided political activists, you could say. "Anything we can help with?" And she tells us she wants us to help Betty and Benjamin Kelly. So this has to be the other hostage, right, the last hostage. Sylvia tells us Benjamin volunteers as a soccer coach for underprivileged kids. So Benjamin is a nice guy; he needs our help. Let's see if Cassandra made any nice, villainous speeches explaining her plan. Doesn't seem like it.

[00:17:34] Let's move back. Keep in mind, Lucas is still on his way, right? So let's go back with Cassandra. Tell her, "We have Sylvia here. The doctor says she'll be fine, but she wants to know, 'Why are you doing this to Benny?'" And she keeps a steady tone, explaining to us that, you know, in her beliefs, it's so that the next generations live better lives, right? Okay. Let's try to counter her political rhetoric with more political rhetoric. She doesn't seem to be convinced with that. "But why is she harming innocents?" And she tells us they were already "victims of the current system." Okay, that's sort of harsh, and we know she's not a cold-blooded person; she helps the community. It's clearly a facade. And you can see from her empathy meter being so high, Cassandra really is breaking down; she's opening up to us. So we shouldn't be convinced by her cold-blooded approach.

[00:18:41] Sylvia has told her what's going on. Here, we can lie and say what she's told us is enough to call down the SWAT team. But let's tell her it's not that bad; we can still work out a deal. Let's leverage our emotional information that Ben is a good guy. Cassandra's voice softened. She's a good person deep down; she doesn't want these people to be harmed. Let's try to see if we can get Benny out. We can't get Benny out. Cassandra knows this is her last option.

[00:19:23] We have Lucas here. Again, like we did with Amatis, we need to get something from Lucas that we can use and leverage to emotionally manipulate Cassandra. Let's talk to Lucas. Let's see if his ride was pleasant. He told us to [**] off. He really doesn't like us. That makes sense. Let's see what his view of the Front is. He seems very proud of his actions so far. "But don't you look like a madman?" He doesn't give a [**]. Let's try to scare him a bit. He's not very scared. Even if we threaten him that Cassandra might die, he says, "Good. And she believed us for murdering her." So he doesn't take any blame for anything that he's done, right? Even if we tell him this is not like him, this seems to be exactly the kind of person he is. So let's see if he agreed to Sylvia being released. He kind of shrugged. Let's see why Cassandra didn't put him on. He doesn't believe that happened, and he accuses us of manipulating her.

[00:20:49] So Cassandra didn't even mention to Lucas that we wanted to speak with him, but she doesn't trust him. Okay. Let's tell Cassandra, "He doesn't want this." She just tells us to "shut up or something." Let's go to Cassandra. We have someone who's with us now; we'll tell her, hopefully, nice for Lucas. Again, that's our strategy: our empathy. Here we have a choice, right? We can tell her that, you know, "If she helps us, we're going to help Lucas," or be honest, tell her what Lucas told us. Let's try to be honest with her and show Cassandra she can trust us. "You should make this sacrifice for the end." She wouldn't give us anything. Oh.

[00:21:40] So at this point, we've been nothing but honest with Cassandra. We've told her what we want is for the hostages to be safe. We know she cares deeply about the safety of those hostages; she doesn't want to hurt them. Let's see if we can make her turn herself in. She really doesn't have anything else. She knows she has a hostage, but she's not very confident. Let's make sure these people come home safe. So at this point, she agrees. She just doesn't... she's not that cold-blooded. She doesn't want to risk anyone getting hurt, actually. And she agrees to come out. Thank you very much for watching.

## Video 6: Episode 6 - Liberation Front Leaders

[00:00:00] Hello, in this video I'll be playing through Episode 6 of *Interrogation: You Will Be Deceived*, illustrating how you can get a confession and win the episode hopefully without having to resort to any sort of enhanced interrogation techniques. This video is intended to help you if you're stuck, but I strongly suggest you stop the video once you feel you have what you need to finish the conversational puzzle on your own so that you don't ruin your experience of the game. There are many ways to finish an episode, and I will be showing you only one of them, so try to go back to the game and discover your own.

[00:00:24] Let's start with the case before us. In Episode 6, we finally have three full-fledged Liberation Front members with enough evidence to convict all of them. We know these people were involved in the string of explosions, rather than the string of bomb attacks, throughout the city. So what we need is not a confession—we already have all we need to convict them. What we need is to understand what the Liberation Front's next target is. That is what we need to extract from these people, which will not be easy, given the fact that they know they're facing a terrorism conviction; they know they have nothing to lose at this point. It's going to be really hard to get them to cooperate with us.

[00:00:57] The three people we have are:

* **Helen Koufos:** She was the actual person that recruited Cassandra Higgs, the woman who did the hostage situation. She is a paying member of a small animal friends organization, participated in protests organized by "Futurist Female," and is a lifetime voter of the Green Party. She's a yoga instructor. She seems to have been handling recruitment for the Liberation Front through numerous chat rooms. She's also deaf and mute, but we will have the aid of an interpreter helping us communicate with her. So Koufos was the recruiter of the Liberation Front.
* **Anton Roscoe:** A porn producer with a reputation for niche fetish production. His studio has been involved in multiple lawsuits, but it seems that Roscoe has reached settlement agreements in all cases. Roscoe seems to have been involved with Gabriel Adams, the priest from Episode 4, and it seems that Anton Roscoe delivered the bomb that Father Adams confessed to have planted. So that's our link we have with Anton Roscoe and the Liberation Front.
* **Linda Bailey:** A widow of a decorated general. She's unemployed. From what we gathered, she's fully dedicated to raising her three sons. They live in a large country house on the outskirts of town. What we uncovered is that Daniel Wilson was blackmailed by Linda Bailey, so she is responsible for blackmailing Daniel Wilson into planting the bomb, Daniel Wilson being the former Marine from Episode 3.

[00:03:00] So at this point, these are our suspects, and we need to find out what their next target is. To do this, my strategy will be to try my best, since I can't scare these people because they are already convicted terrorists, I will try to build up empathy with them, show them that I really understand what they're going through. At this point in the game, we've talked with so many Liberation Front members, I can make a convincing case that I really understand what they're doing and what they're all about, and see if that may open them up in any way.

[00:03:39] So I'm going to be really polite with Koufos here. "Do you have a few questions?" She greets us back using an interpreter helping us communicate. Let's see what her story is. Again, we can be very aggressive, but I'm going to be calm. I'm going to tell her that I'm very interested in her, and she seems to smile slightly; she seems to like that. Okay, let's talk a bit about yoga, why not? Let's do some small talk, and she returns the question, "Why did we choose policing?" Well, of course, we chose policing because it's "cool." So let's see if she's happy in her life. Again, someone involved in terrorism must be unhappy about something. So she says she's comfortable, but that she can't be happy in a world in which the rich exploit the poor through capital and religion. So she has very, very extreme left-leaning political views, and that seems to be her motivation to act in the Liberation Front. Interesting.

[00:04:52] Let's talk to her about Cassandra. Helen recruited Cassandra. Doesn't she feel guilty about any of this? Let's see, "What did she teach Cassandra to do?" And again, we can tell her that Cassandra broke, or that she didn't owe us anything. Let's make her more confident. It sounded insane, but that she is facing life in jail. She tells us that the "military-industrial complex will victimize Cassandra, have her killed in a prison incident." Okay, we hate the military-industrial complex too. We hate it. Okay, we see we've built up empathy with her.

[00:05:32] Let's see, "How can you justify all the suffering?" Let's try to understand a bit more this terrorist's point of view. Hmm, so she seems to be suffering; she seems to be feeling bad about all the suffering she has caused. Let's see what she tried to achieve: "dissolving all of the powers from its capital, authority, religion, gender, and social worlds." Okay, so a very anarchistic view of the world. "But isn't harming innocents wrong?" She says that they are "consumers back from the rot in the world that we live in," but she looks down while she says that. So I'm not entirely convinced; I think she's just justifying herself by saying that; I don't think she really believes that. "How do you go from yoga trainer to being a recruiter?" "Both guide the soul to fulfillment." Okay.

[00:06:29] Let's see, "Who's your boss?" She says she only answered to Linda. So at this point, we had Helen Koufos telling us that Linda Bailey was her direct superior. That's something very useful. So let's talk a bit more about these other two people. Let's see if they know each other. We know Linda Bailey, and she tells us that Linda was the one in charge of their whole operation cell. So all three were in the same operation cell. "Linda refused to have her sons recruited into the Front." So they tried to recruit Linda Bailey's sons, but Linda refused. Okay, so we understand that. "If Linda knew that if the movement fails, at least the kids can watch the freak show in the first row?" "Not from me." So Linda is thinking about her children. But even if the Liberation Front movement fails, at least, spiritually, behind bars. Boom.

[00:07:32] So at this point, what we know is that Helen was the main recruiter. She feels kinda bad for what she did, but she thinks her fight is the fight against capitalism, the military-industrial complex. She reported to Linda. "Does she know anything?" She doesn't really. Maybe we should ask Linda, but we won't do that just yet.

[00:07:56] Let's move to Roscoe, the porn producer. "Why would he risk a successful business?" Well, he says that even though he makes good money, you know, you gotta change the world. "Good thinking, Mr. Roscoe; we have to change the world." "So what's your story?" He's a self-made man, always looking for bigger things. We can mock him, or we can flatter him. Let's try to flatter him. He bites it instantly. He's glad we "watched his stuff." "I would never buy porn, though." Not a great answer. He just says he was "married to porn" and that it motivated him. He's clearly very excited about his business; he sees it as an art. "What does your art express?" "Is it a prediction on how we're progressing?" "How we're ruled by feminazis and others?" So it's clearly, already, that Anton Roscoe here has very, very different views from Helen; he has a very far-right political view of the world.

[00:08:52] Let's talk a bit about his scandals. Let's try to empathize with him a bit. It's hard to empathize with Roscoe, but let's try. Let's try to play him. Let's try to manipulate him. Let's ease his mind. He says he would like to do more for the Front before he "cracks," but he didn't have enough time. "Does he have any family?" Again, we could mock him. He says he keeps his business private. I'm sure if we go back here...

[00:09:40] Let's talk a bit about his terrorist activity. Let's see, "Who gave you your orders?" He says he "did his own thing." Again, we know that Linda was the boss of this whole operation, which is extremely important. Let's see if we can confront him. He doesn't really want to admit to that yet. So let's see if we can push him a bit more. "Where did you get your explosives?" Well, he actually acquired them himself. "Plus, you know where they were. We used them." He doesn't really know. He doesn't seem to be thinking about it. He doesn't care about the innocents. He doesn't care that we disarmed this bomb. He doesn't really know how explosives are made, so we know he didn't make the bomb, but he says he was "key to the whole operation." Okay, but we know he doesn't know how to make bombs; he doesn't know the operation. He was just a delivery person.

[00:10:55] Let's see if we can make him admit to that. Let's talk about Helen. Let's see what he thinks about Linda. He says, "They don't talk too much." Well, makes sense, given their extremely different political views. Let's try to play these ones against each other by telling him that Koufos disagrees with his political views. Here, we have another option open. He wasn't responding, but since we know so much now, and now, with his patriotism piqued, we can help him. Tell him that the people in this organization obviously have no respect for him and his great art form, and that we need to know what the next move is, then we'll get him a good deal. He cracks up; he was just a delivery boy after all. He tells us that "there's a big one coming up," but that's all he knows. We could press for more, but I don't think he knows more; he just played us.

[00:11:58] Let's move on to Linda. Linda, the boss of the operation. Let's try to play nicely with Linda. If she was the boss, she must be really, really smart. So let's flatter her for being a good mom. "The terrorism thing, as you call it, is also part of being a good mom." Well, doesn't she have a very flawed view of what motherhood is? But it lets you watch her stories. She's just a "mama bear," so she really identifies with her role as a mother. That's what she's about: raising her children, making sure they have a good future. We know that about her, so probably making the world a better place is part of being a mom, right? Absolutely, so she agrees with us; we got that right.

[00:12:49] Let's see who's going to take care of the kids, her parents? "Did anyone know about the Liberation Front?" Koufos told us Linda kept her kids away, and she confirms that. Now we have to see how we approach this. We can tell her she's just creating a more dangerous world, or that we actually understand the Front—she did this because of her kids; she believed the Front would make a better world for her kids. Let's try to do that. Our empathy with her raises again, and she tells us that she wants to ensure that "they never know the world we have come to."

[00:13:39] Moving back here. We know she was the one that blackmailed Daniel Wilson. Let's see why. "Daniel needed help with his mother, so she tried to help." So she really thinks she's the good person in all of this, right? We can press her on that, but we're playing this sort of... we're trying to get under her skin. Let's try two more. We have two other friends. We know Helen has a very left-leaning view. We know Anton has a very far-right view. So a very fair question is, "How do you keep them working together?" And then she reveals a bit of the inside workings of the Liberation Front by telling us she just makes sure they have no time to discuss their outlooks on life and society, and she considers their outlooks "naive." So it doesn't seem that Linda has a very ideologically charged view; it seems like she's against ideology to begin with.

[00:14:48] Finally, let's talk more about explosives. She organized since she was the one who actually crafted explosives. Let's see where she sent them: "to all sorts of nice people." She doesn't want to tell us that, even though she seems to be opening up to us; she really isn't ready. We know she was the boss. She says it was her own initiative. We know, both from Helen and from Anton, and from Linda, that she is high-ranking, but she's probably not the overall boss of the entire Liberation Front. Let's try to challenge her with that. She's silent for a couple of seconds, then she says, "Lady Luck trusts me with managing my own cell." Lady Luck is the person who, if you read the newspapers, wrote one of the very popular manifestos that spread throughout the internet and basically promoted the Liberation Front's propaganda. She's very widely read; she is one of the main promoters of the Liberation Front online through her writings. Here, Linda is telling us that Lady Luck trusts her, so it's clear that this Lady Luck (who is obviously a real person) is the boss.

[00:16:16] Let's go back. Let's finally try to see what Factory Anton told us about, because we know it's effective for Anton. She seems a bit surprised, impressed actually, and all traces of fear seem to fade away. She's impressed we found out about them. She congratulates us and tells us it's "going off very soon." A timer suddenly starts, because if it's blowing up very soon, we need to get to it fast. All of these yellow questions are from different things we uncovered throughout the game. We know she's in leadership, close to Lady Luck. We know Linda knows what happened. So, what's the plan? She wants to tell us. We know Linda doesn't believe in ideology. Ideology is just a distraction. We can try to persuade her with that; she nods.

[00:17:21] Finally, let's tell her that we just want to take back control over our lives as well. We can try to play along, because we found that... and smiling widely, Linda thinks we're on board with her, that perhaps the Liberation Front has convinced us, the player, too. So, "Let me see the 'freak show.' In the end, we will strike back against ourselves." Let's click on that, and we've managed to manipulate Linda into believing that we empathize with the Liberation Front; we understand it, and we just want to see a nice explosion because we're actually on the Liberation Front's side. She gives us the address, and we can now act on that. Thank you very much for watching.

## Video 7: Episode 7 - The Weapons Plant Bomb

[00:00:00] Hello, in this video I'll be playing through Episode 7 of *Interrogation: You Will Be Deceived*, illustrating how I can get a confession and win the episode hopefully without having to resort to any sort of enhanced interrogation techniques. This video is intended to help you if you're stuck, but I strongly suggest you stop the video once you feel you have what you need to finish the conversational puzzle on your own so that you don't ruin your own experience of the game. There are many ways to finish an episode, and I will only be showing you one of them, so try to get back in the game and discover your own.

[00:00:27] Let's start with the case before us. In Episode 7, we're following up with the information Linda Bailey has provided about a bomb being planted at a weapons plant. Unfortunately for us, we don't have much to go on, and the factory has been put on lockdown with all the employees being already evacuated when we got there. Apparently, the cyber security of the factory has been breached, and the lockdown has been initiated—a lockdown that not even the security experts employed by the factory can understand what happened. So our objective here is to break this lockdown or find some way to break this lockdown, defuse the bomb, and make sure that this factory doesn't blow up.

[00:01:10] To assist us with that, we have three very interesting people:

* **Aaron King:** He is the founder and the majority shareholder of the company that owns the facility. He's a well-known entrepreneur; he's very rich and very influential in the city, and he's the one that essentially built this business, right? So he is the one that owns this place; he could give us some interesting insights into how the cybersecurity works, perhaps.
* **Steve Muradin:** He is the chief of security of the factory. It's just obvious that we should be working with him. This is less so a person that we're interrogating per se; we could just be asking him here for help. But he's also one of the people who could have had the sort of security access needed to ensure this sort of lockdown.
* **Tab:** Tab is here because before she worked with us, she worked as a security auditor, and one of her audits was made at this factory, which means that she might have had access to the back-end security of this factory, and she's one of the only people we know that could have possibly done this.

[00:02:41] So these are our three people. None of them have a direct motive for doing this, so this will be very difficult to do, but we'll go through it. Let's bring them in. You'll see that this is a timed episode. Although we have a lot of time, we have to be very careful what we ask.

[00:03:07] The first thing we want to do is introduce ourselves to all the suspects here. I will go and just run for an empathy strategy, so I'll try to be polite, I'll try to be kind, and I'll try to make each suspect believe I'm on their side. So let's start with Mr. King. Let's be nice with him, tell him we're here to do the job. Do the same, Muradin, we're working with a professional. Very happy about that. Tab, I'm very sorry we have to do this.

[00:03:44] The first thing we want to do is understand how these security codes even work, right? So let's discuss the situation with Tab. Let's see, "How do these security cards even work?" And let's ask her just that. She tells us it's a multi-key code stored on multiple physical devices. Now, in the real world, that's a very real thing; this is how the most secure digital locks work: there's a physical element to it, stored in multiple places. So this makes sense; it's probably not a lie. Let's see who could have had access, and she tells us the factory owner and the chief of security are the only ones that held the codes on a permanent basis. This is Aaron King and Steve Muradin, right here. But she admits also, "the auditor would have had access for a limited time when she did the audit." So Tab could have had the access. Okay.

[00:04:47] But let's see if there's any way to circumvent this, in Tab's opinion, as a security auditor. She tells us that it could have only been circumvented using the access codes of one of these three people. And because there are no access logs, someone must have created a backdoor, right? So what she tells us is because no one logged the use of a security key, that means someone else had a way to get in here, right, through a backdoor. Now Tab couldn't put the backdoor in when she audited the place. Muradin could have done this, as he worked here for years. Or King could have done this, as he built the place.

[00:05:27] Let's ask each one of them what their opinion on this is. So let's discuss the situation, let's discuss the access code. Muradin just tells us he doesn't want to talk with us about that; that's private information. That's all right. We just want to know this so that we could save your factory and your job. Let's see how strongly he believes in the encryption. He says it's "unlikely that anyone could ever break the encryption." So this links up with what Tab says, right? If we have no logs of any keys being used, and he tells us there's no way to break the encryption, then the theory that there's a backdoor created is already established as the most likely one. Let's see if he confirms to have access to the memory sticks. He can gradually just for the job well done, we see. Within a reason, he just talked to Tab. We rely on that very much. He admits he has one. King has one, and Muradin does. This is confirmed at this point: all three could have had access to this. Let's ask him about a backdoor, and he says that he knows no backdoor was built at the start, and he should know this, but he says that someone with access could have built one afterwards. Now, I don't understand how that cybersecurity works, but I'm going to try and believe.

[00:06:48] Let's see what King thinks about this. Let's see what he thinks about the current situation and about the access codes. He tells us that he's "no expert." Well, after our discussions, we're kind of experts. Let's tell him that we're just trying to make sure his memory stick has not been compromised. This shows that we are informed of the situation, but we're not putting any pressure on him. He says, "Yeah, sure." Let's ask him about the backdoor. He smiles and says that "maybe he should have installed" one. Let's say that even if he did, there's nothing wrong with that. And he looks worried, saying he doesn't know what we're talking about. So at this point, this tells me that we have not raised our empathy or our fear enough with him for him admitting that.

[00:07:52] So let's discuss some other things with him. Let's discuss some personal things with him. Let's try to understand what sort of person we're dealing with here, since we don't want that information from the security breach with him. So let's see, let's do some small talk with him, talk with him about his businesses. This is one of the interesting choices you have when it comes to how you approach King. He is obviously a very rich businessman, an entrepreneur, an industrialist. So we have here very politically charged statements. We can accuse the corporations, we can say that corporations are meritocratic, we can talk about worker abuse, or we can talk about predatory capitalism. So these are all statements that will influence how we rapport with King. I will go with complementing his capitalist view of the world and not disagreeing.

[00:08:52] So at this point, I know that this person is a strong capitalist, he believes in free market and all that stuff. So this is how I will approach every other conversation or every other choice I have with him: trying to raise my empathy with him. Let's see what he means by "never leaving money on the table." He tells us that you know, you should do the best with any financial opportunity you have. Good advice right there. What does he mean by "having an exit strategy?" He talks about long-term endeavors that are more profitable, so you should be able to be flexible. Well, interesting, but getting your factory blown up doesn't tell me that you are flexible. It just tells me your business is under threat. Let's see how King views inherited wealth. He's a man who inherited wealth, but didn't use that wealth profitably. Okay. "What other businesses does he own?" He says this is his main investment; there was never any need to diversify his portfolio. "What makes it so profitable?" Basically, he's selling to the government; that will always be profitable. "Isn't that risky, though?" And he tells us that his "basket," right—the business is insured and financed by the state. So at this point, we know that even if it blows up, there's no one inside. All the workers are out. Even if it blows up, his factory is insured; he's not going to lose any money from this. We still have to stop this explosion because we don't want to give the win to the Liberation Front.

[00:11:00] Let's talk more about the situation with him. See if he wants to tell us about the backdoor now that we've raised our empathy with him. And he does. He installed the private backdoor. "It's only natural; I mean, it's his property, he can do whatever he wants." So I think it makes sense. Let's just double check. He admits he kept it for convenience. "Interesting. Why did he keep this a secret?" He just tells us he "didn't want to bother with it." Probably Muradin would have been on his ass if Muradin knew about this. So I guess it makes sense. "Who knew about this?" "Just him and now us." Okay. "But why did he need it?" And he says he "enjoys connecting remotely to the cameras and keeping an eye on the place." Okay, that's kind of creepy, but I guess if you're very passionate about your business, it makes sense.

[00:11:45] So at this point, we know about Aaron King that he had backdoor access to the factory. We know his factory is insured; even if it blows up, he has nothing to lose. And we know he strongly empathizes with hardcore capitalist ideals. So if we try to challenge him, he tells us that he "wouldn't want to damage his own property, the one that he invested so much" in. Let's talk some more about his business, about him being a weapons manufacturer. He says he "wouldn't touch morals to his business." So he is clearly thinking only about money here.

[00:12:32] Let's talk a bit about this. Basically, what we're trying to look for is some ways to raise his empathy. Nothing here. Let's keep looking. Let's talk some more about his factory; maybe there's something here. He says he employs hundreds of people. Interesting. Let's keep looking. His clients are governments, most likely. Let's see if his insurance covers terrorist attacks. This is an absolute. Here, we can accuse him, or we can empathize with him, saying that we're glad he will at least be able to rebuild. He says this is a minor setback and that they will put this back together. Let's see if he's willing to crack now. He just admits, "There's too much." We have him on tape saying he had the place insured against terrorist attacks, which I think is a very rare thing to do. He admits he built the backdoor in without his security chief knowing about it, and he admits he works with the Liberation Front. He gives us this really big speech. We missed our time.

[00:14:03] Let's go with our strategy: keep telling him we understand, we empathize. Let's see what he hopes to accomplish. He says nothing really; it's just symbolism, a protest against the government and its practices, even with the military. Now we know King is a capitalist; he believes in the free market; he only sees the government as a customer. And we know he has no moral qualms about being a weapons dealer. So this seems to me like a rehearsed statement, something that he says but I don't think he actually believes. So, let's criticize the government – ain't nice, right?

[00:14:45] Let's talk about the Liberation Front a bit more. "Why would he target his own factory?" He says it was the easiest target; the Front identified it as a short-term sacrifice he had to make. Again, putting everything together, King clearly loves his business, clearly loves doing business. Although he won't lose money on this explosion, it seems to me he wouldn't have liked to have done this if he had any other alternative. So, the Front identified this business. I don't think King is totally fine with this. This is our way; this is how we can leverage King. Convince him that maybe there's a better way to do this; you don't have to blow up your own factory. We have an option that is in line with our strategy there: telling him that "people are easy to tell others to tear something down when they haven't built it themselves." And sure enough, look at our empathy bar raising; he agrees with us. "How long has he been working?" He doesn't really keep track of that.

[00:15:59] Let's see if he believes this move – is this a PR stunt where Lady Luck will actually work with all the discussion it will cause? It would be the only logical conclusion. Here, we can confront him with our own knowledge. Now that we've dealt with so many Liberation Front members in this episode and read so much about them, we know that Lady Luck sometimes says that "violence invites interpretation or judgment." So, let's try to beat this Liberation Front member with his own ideology. He surprisingly agrees with Lady Luck, but he still believes people will interpret this correctly. Let's see if we can convince him to stop this explosion. We know that he doesn't agree with violence. He says there's no alternative, but we know there is. Let's try to convince him there's another way.

[00:17:02] Now we need to offer him some sort of other way, because we're desperate at this point. If one blows up, this is just another failure on our track record, so we will most certainly get fired. We have to somehow convince this man that there's a better way for him, or for the Liberation Front, rather than blowing up that building. Let's try to see if he has any options for that. He rightly tells us that us losing our job will only help the Front. Here, we have a deception option. We can tell him that our orders come from Lady Luck. Since our empathy is very high with him, he's not really willing to trust us, but it doesn't seem far-fetched to him. We can convince him that, yes, we're part of the Liberation Front, and that we can prove it. We can give him something like this—"Ben Avis," telling him that this is the guy we're after, a Liberation Front member. We can tell King, "Now listen, you: I give you better ways and tell him we're after him, and you stop this explosion." And he says he texted Ben Avis to get away. Get him a computer, and that's that. So this is how you finish Episode 7. There are many other ways to do it. Thank you very much for watching.

## Video 8: Episode 8 - The Interrogation

[00:00:00] Hello, in this episode I'll be playing through Episode 8 of *Interrogation: You Will Be Deceived*, illustrating how I can get past this episode and not get fired. This is intended to help you if you're stuck, but I strongly suggest you stop the video once you feel you have what you need to finish the conversational puzzle on your own so that you don't ruin your experience of the game. There are many ways to finish an episode, and I will only be showing you one of them, so try to get back in the game and discover your own.

[00:00:24] So in Episode 8, we're dealing with a reverse situation. We are now being interrogated because, although we think we've done a great job, many bombs have blown up in the city that we weren't able to catch. This is back in Episode 3. Also, to finish Episode 7, we had to give a tip to a Liberation Front member, and that resulted in someone, Ben Avis, actually escaping from us. So this is also... you know, we put pressure on certain suspects, or perhaps in your playthrough you may have used enhanced interrogation; who knows, right? So this episode will actually be different depending on what perks you have, if you've used enhanced interrogation or not, what sort of dialogue options you went for in different episodes. So this guy will drill you down for everything you did.

[00:01:21] How you need to approach this is: put yourself in that situation. You need to prove to this man that you're not incompetent, that you can still do your job and you can do it well, and you deserve to lead this operation. And you need to prove to him that you're not somehow persuaded by the Liberation Front, that although you've tipped off a Liberation Front member, you didn't do that because you somehow agree with the Front. So these are the two things you need to keep in mind when you play this episode. I will give you my walkthrough, but yours will be different because of your different perks and your different choices, right? But this is the strategy you have to keep in mind: make him believe you're not incompetent, and make him believe you are surely fighting against the Liberation Front, right? So this is what we're trying to do here.

[00:02:27] "Do we understand why we're here?" Again, let's analyze this option. If we're saying that our team has performed adequately in all of our tests, we know that's a lie, right? We haven't done the best, perfect job. Sometimes we had to take some shortcuts. We can say that there's some internal affairs [__], so we can push him a bit, annoy him, but tell him, you know, this proves a bit more competence, but that might annoy. Or we can say, "Ethical constraints." This is the most truthful one, but this proves a bit of incompetence from our part, because we agree that, you know, these are ethical concerns; they're hard stuff. "I don't know if I can handle it. It's a perilous sea," right? So these are the sort of options you will always have, the things you will have to consider.

[00:03:25] So let's go with "Ethical constraints." He nods. He says, "Yes, that's why we're here." He asks us, "Do we have any ethical breaches that we would like to declare?" I will just agree and say, "We know that giving up that man was a bad thing." He nods. He accuses that Ben Avis got away as a direct consequence of our actions. We tell him we took a calculated risk. He also drills us for our leadership style; he wants us to look for how much we take up responsibility. So let's say "a strong sense of hierarchy." He says that does that indeed. "Well then, you must accept full responsibility," which we will do. He asked us if our intent was to help Ben Avis. Again, this is the sort of question we would ask a suspect. You don't have high enough empathy or fear with me to get me to answer that. So let's just tell the truth: "We did this to get King to stop the bomb."

[00:04:40] And then he asks about Daniel Wilson from Episode 3. "Why is it that we believe he was not a member of the Liberation Front?" We know Daniel Wilson was blackmailed, and he wasn't a member of the Liberation Front. We can tell him just that. He asks us, "Why Alex, Alex from Episode 4, why was he not in the Liberation Front?" We know he was not, because he worked with the priest. The priest was the mastermind behind it, and he just manipulated Alex into doing some things for him. Alex didn't even understand that he was buying bomb materials. So I will go for exactly that option; I will just tell the truth.

[00:05:30] Then he wants to ask us about the management, which tells us that we have demotivated our agents. Let's tell him that we just try to do our best. We've given interviews in the past, or hopefully you've given interviews in the past in your playthrough. We'll just say, "We understand this necessity." Go for the safe option. We act as if we believe that we're the good guys. Let's just tell him, "We're doing our job."

[00:06:00] Now he gets up. Now he's trying to intimidate us, right? This is the sort of strategy we could use with our suspects: make them uncomfortable, make them scared. And he's using that on us right now. "It's just a euphemism, we're only cooperating." "Calm down," right? And now he drills us about all these Liberation Front members that have opened up to us. So we've had some strange success, right? And he admittedly is quite suspicious of that. "Why do we have this magical gift?" Well, because we're extremely smart and intelligent. Here's a very easy trap for you: we could just say, "If the judicious use of enhanced interrogation techniques," and that will instantly get you fired, right? As you admit on tape, this is probably recorded, right? There's a microphone right here. This will just instantly get you fired. If we say, "Maybe their leadership told them to try to open up to us," that raises suspicion, right? Why would their leadership tell them to confess to us in particular? Perhaps that means we have a connection to the Liberation Front leadership. So I just tell him, "We're good at what we do."

[00:07:22] He still doesn't like us. "Do you find it acceptable that we've psychologically tormented several of these as well?" I wouldn't go for psychological torment, but I won't speak for any of you watching at your place, right? I haven't done any of that, and I would regret it deeply if we did. "And we then intimidate and manipulate innocent people?" "Did they deserve to do this?" "Absolutely not." He tells us that we were "too sympathetic to the Liberation Front's points of view." We know we did that to manipulate the Liberation Front members, but he doesn't know that. And we can just tell him that we tried to trick them.

[00:08:04] He gets a bit more angry, tries to scare us a bit more. He tells us that the "Liberation Front will not be allowed to flourish as a cancer to be spread by incompetent traitors." If he's not nervous, let's just tell him, "You know, calm down." He screams at us, tells him that we're not in control here. So he's trying to scare us, right? He's asking us, with his eyes twitching, "Are we ready to die to end these monsters?" Of course not, we're not fanatics. He asks us, "What do we stand for in all of this?" We could have different options here depending on your playthrough. "We stand for the law." And just like that, he suddenly calmed down. So this was probably a trick from his part; he's just trying to push us, intimidate us; he's not going to get us fired, right?

[00:09:15] So this is the end of the episode. We didn't get fired; we didn't have anything bad happen to us. So I hope this video helps you. Depending on your playthrough, again, your episode might be different, but if you keep yourself professional, never openly agree or admit that you empathize with the Liberation Front, and never openly admit that you've, for example, used enhanced interrogation techniques, you should be able to get past this episode and get back to cracking down on the Liberation Front. Thank you very much.

## Video 9: Episode 9 - The Core Leaders

[00:00:00] Hello, in this video we'll be playing through Episode 9 of *Interrogation: You Will Be Deceived*, illustrating how you can get a confession and win the episode hopefully without having to resort to any sort of enhanced interrogation techniques. This video is intended to help you if you're stuck, but I strongly suggest you stop the video once you feel you have what you need to finish the conversational puzzle on your own so that you don't ruin your experience of the game. There are many ways to finish an episode, and I will be showing you only one of them, so try to get back in the game and discover your own.

[00:00:24] Let's start with the case before us. So before we start Episode 9, we're given this choice of which suspects to bring. We can only bring two out of these four suspects. There are many hints throughout the game that help you make this decision. This might seem like a random decision at first, but there are hints throughout the game as to which of these you should choose. I'm going to tell you right now: there are certain combinations that you just can't win, right? So for example, if you read the newspapers that are periodically offered to you, if you talk to some of the people that you get from the missions, they might give you certain hints, but they're very nuanced, and you have to be careful, right? So I'm going to give you one very important hint: in order to finish Episode 9, you have to have either Anomaly or Damascus Reed in your choice. You can have any combination you want as long as one of the suspects you bring is either Anomaly or Damascus Reed, or both. So one of these two people has to be the ones you bring in.

[00:01:29] Anomaly is a reputed sociology professor, and Damascus Reed is a well-known entrepreneur. So let's bring these two in. Again, you can bring other combinations as long as one of them is brought in, one of them is required. So here's what you need to do to win Episode 9.

[00:01:54] Let's bring them in. For this playthrough, I'll focus on Damascus. And here's another interesting aspect with Episode 9: you have to be careful in this episode to manage both your empathy and your fear at the same time. You will need both of these stats at different moments in the game in order to finish the episode, right? Keep in mind, you have nothing on these people; you just have a hunch that one of them might be involved with the Liberation Front, and the case file tells you just that, right? You basically had this tip about these four people booking a flight, and this is a suspicion you have, but these people probably know you have nothing solid on them. So you have to make them trust you, and you have to intimidate them so that they know they're in trouble, right? You have to convince them they're in trouble, and then they have to trust you enough that you can get them out of trouble. That's the sort of approach you need to have.

[00:03:00] First of all, with Damascus, I will focus on making him trust me. So this is what we'll try to do: we will try to be polite with him. And you have to be very careful wherever you have these sort of choices; you have to be very careful which one you pick. It will influence these stats here, and you have to pick them right strategically.

[00:03:26] So first of all, let's be polite to him. Although he shakes his head in outrage, we see his empathy rising. We will raise his empathy even more. "Yes, the truth is nuanced. This is what I'm here to ask: just a few questions." And he says he doesn't know why we're "taking a swing at him," we "must have been manipulated." Well, perhaps. But let's start, right? So what we want to do is go through these options carefully, and keep an eye on the red question, seeing if it changes at any point. That might give us a hint that we can now press him.

[00:04:12] The first thing we want to know is: all of these four people have a very important lawyer coming to defend all of them. So let's talk to him about that. "How come two people that don't know each other have the same lawyer?" He says he "wasn't even aware" that he has a lawyer. Well, let's just try to be polite; this is his right to have a lawyer. His empathy is rising up even more, but he doesn't know. He basically says he doesn't know. "Maybe Avocado, his lawyer?" Maybe not. He's not willing to tell us anything. But if we try to push him a bit more, he admits that, yeah, after all, he called one. Let's try to ask him, "Why did you try lying to us?" "First of all, we all learn not to talk to the cops." Well, I guess that might be true in your case.

[00:05:07] Let's try to find out why he contacted this lawyer to represent everyone, all the suspects he brought in. He says because "you've pulled this out of thin air with no warrant, more lawsuits are better than one." So he is claiming that this is just a scheme; he's pulling to have a stronger defense in case we're trying to abuse our power in any way. Well, let us try to calm him down, saying that, "Yeah, you know, that sounds smart. The city costs money anyway. What do I care?" He says, "Finally, a public servant that understands how the state works." Okay, so at this point, our empathy with him is pretty high. He thinks we're cool, you know, we're the cool cop. Let's see what he thinks about this. He says, "I can't trust her as far as I can throw you." Let's see if he's willing to talk to us anyway. And he says, "We're someone who can be reasonable and cool-headed." This is because we have high empathy with him. He says he "doesn't confess," "won't confess [__]," but let's say he can give us some advice. "What sort of advice?" "I've run international operations. I have to establish networks, motivate people, recruit. I've done it all." All of these things sound like the sort of things a terrorist leader would have to do. So let's say, "Okay, let's see what sort of advice he can give us."

[00:06:40] And here we have a very long list of questions we can ask him to try to understand how a Liberation Front would work. Again, he's not confessing to anything; he's just giving this theoretical advice, right? So we can go through this conversation with him and try to understand if he were to be a Liberation Front leader, how would he run it? Now we've made him discuss with us on a theoretical level. If he were to be a leader, is he willing to discuss with us in theoretical terms? Because he doesn't feel very afraid at this point; he might think we have nothing against him, but he trusts us enough to at least give us some advice. So he's giving us this direct conversation, but he's not... he doesn't feel threatened.

[00:07:37] So at this point, we need to raise his fear so that he actually feels pressured to giving us more, right? He needs to feel threatened. You can always stop the recorder and give him some physical threat if that's what you need, but I suggest you don't do that. So I suggest you read through all of these conversations. These will be very useful in the next episode. It's very important that you understand how the Liberation Front might work. So in questions like these, now we need to pick the options that will raise his fear, right? We want to put pressure on him, so we have to read perhaps his file, get a view on this person, get a read on this person, see what might actually make him feel threatened. For example, when asked, "How does an organization like a violent one fund itself?" He says, "They don't have a revenue source; they haven't been robbing banks and selling drugs." So that means someone must be funding them, and we can make a very smart assumption, for example, saying that in return, if someone were to fund them, then the Liberation Front might be harming their competitors, right? He says he doesn't think so, but we can see his heart rate spiking.

[00:08:52] Now, what we want to know is, "How is the Liberation Front led?" He says they "have their hands in many projects and handle many things at once." They must have a "small core of dedicated people pulling the strings." "Interesting. How many of them?" "Probably just an administrative part," he says, "so it would have to be uneven: three, five, seven, something like that, but small enough for quick decisions." "How would the hierarchy look between these leaders?" He says it would probably "not be an official hierarchy between these leaders," so as to "not offend anyone's ego." "What if a number of the leaders were to leave?" Then the others would want things, but you know, "each leader might try to pull the organization in different directions." So let's tell him that, and he says that yes, this may be true, especially if they "don't trust the ones left to do good work." So at this point, we planted the seed of doubt in his mind. If he is a Liberation Front leader, we now have given him a reason for concern because we might not put him in jail; we might put other leaders in jail. Or if we put just him in jail, then the other leaders of the Liberation Front will be able to do with it as they please, against perhaps Damascus Reed's interests.

[00:10:10] So let's try to talk about some other things with him, some more pressure on him. Let's discuss his background as a businessman and let's see how one with his background, a rich entrepreneur, ends up being the leader of the terrorist organization. He says, "That's just some random theory we have." But you know, a person in his position could use the Liberation Front as a means to push for, for example, a breakdown of laws and regulations that he might feel hold back his background. And yes, his fear has risen because, you know, he might be feeling that we're getting onto him. But he tells us, "You know what, bribes haven't happened; I've suddenly stopped working." So, you know, he admits to the fact that he's more than willing to corrupt, or to use, in his opinion, the corrupt government for his own ends. So this is a very incriminating statement in my point of view.

[00:11:13] Finally, let's go back and discuss the Liberation Front with him again for a minute. Let's see what is his opinion on the Front. He says that "as long as they don't disrupt his operation, he doesn't care." "What does this huge rift of their means?" He says he "likes their PR," but he "doesn't think much of their bluff, irrational behavior." He liked the way they message themselves, but we know that the Liberation Front has many messages. Let's see what he believes about the "down with the rich" messages. He says it "saddens him." Again, his heart rate is spiking. He hopes that they will understand that the concept of class warfare is absurd. "Let's see if you agree to their motives." "They haven't assumed any demands or even objectives." Well, we know that's not exactly true; they have an assumed objective of fighting against the status quo in all its ways. But let's try to scare him with that. Let's say that "that just means they will fight aimlessly, destroying everything people like you have built, especially if we put you in jail, Mr. Reed." And he says, "Let's just hope you stopped them before that happens." He's trying to deceive us perhaps.

[00:12:28] So at this point, we had very high empathy and very high fear with him. Let's try to see if he's willing to confess to us. And he says he "can't give us what we want." "That's not how this works." We can tell him that we can either go to prison and let the Liberation Front be stolen from him, or he can give us something we can use. And he says again, he "can't give us what we want," but he's willing to make an opening. He'll give us two other names of the people we should really talk to: potential other leaders of the Front. So we've convinced him that if we just put him in jail, the other two might pervert the cause. So he doesn't really trust the other two. So that will be a very useful information for the next episode. But until then, thank you very much for watching, and I hope you find other interesting ways to finishing this episode. Goodbye.

## Video 10: Episode 10 - The Grand Finale

[00:00:00] Hello, in this video I'll be playing through Episode 10 of *Interrogation: You Will Be Deceived*, illustrating how you can get a confession and win the episode and the game, hopefully without having to resort to any sort of enhanced interrogation techniques. Well, in this episode, you can't either way. This video is intended to help you if you're stuck, but I strongly suggest you stop the video once you feel you have what you need to finish the conversational puzzle on your own so that you don't ruin your experience of the game. There are many ways to finish an episode, and I will only be showing you one of them, so try to get back in the game and discover your own.

[00:00:29] Let's start with the case before us. So what we have are the three Liberation Front members right here in front of us:

* **Anomaly:** A reputed sociology professor. She does lectures, she does work analyzing societal behavior and failed states. She has very left-leaning views, and she is a leader of an international terrorist organization.
* **Damascus Reed:** A well-known entrepreneur, business guru. He's the CEO of a very large tech enterprise, and he's also a leader of an international terrorist organization. He has very capitalist political views.
* **James Bennett:** A former soldier. He lives in exile in the mountains with his family. We have no idea what sort of political views he has.

[00:01:46] In this episode, you are not allowed to use the recorder to stop the recorder and use any sort of enhanced interrogation techniques. More than that, because of a deal that you signed with their lawyer, they cannot incriminate themselves with anything they say. So the strategy here is to make them incriminate each other by essentially persuading them that one of the other leaders, or maybe both of them, are a detriment to the Liberation Front, and that they should give them to us, and then they can walk free. Basically, or at least, that's our strategy; that is how we should try to persuade them. I will go through these questions very fast, but I suggest that when you play the episode, actually read what they say, but there are many things to go through as we have to extract not a confession, but basically a "rat out" from each and every one.

[00:02:40] So with Anomaly, our strategy is: she's our ideology expert, she's the ideological leader, and we want to start with this one right here: "Perfect Equity." Basically, what we want to do is go through these options, and whenever we have a choice, we want to raise her empathy or her fear with us. Depending on what perks you have, you will have different choices. I will go for empathy on this one, so I will try to raise her empathy as high as I can by, you know, agreeing with left-wing views, trying to manipulate her that, you know, "I'm really on board with all this Marxist stuff." "Sure, charisma is good. Motivating? Inflaming?" You see her empathy is rising. Keep going through these options. This is an untimed episode, so you can take your time and do what you want. She would focus on maintaining ideological integrity. She believes in non-discrimination, redistribution of wealth, a culture of acceptance that spans all gender and identity. So that is a very social justice sort of worldview. Keep that in mind for later. So this is her view on a left-leaning, Marxist Liberation Front. Keep going through the options. Again, try to raise empathy. In questions like these, be sure to try to keep your strategy as much as possible. Don't try to mix and match intimidate and try to get them to trust you; just focus on one. So in this one, I'll just go with "people have unaware..." and she says, "Yeah, of course, that's the dangerous nature of capitalism." So again, keep going through all of these, try to find those works, and this is the real Liberation Front.

[00:05:01] You will have different options depending on what sort of missions you did, what sort of discussions you had in the past with any of these suspects or with other suspects. But we want to see what they believe about the others. So about Reed, they have some common social circles, but she assumes that Reed comes to her conferences only to argue with her. So we know these two don't really get along; I guess it makes sense.

[00:05:37] And about James Bennett... she held lectures. Okay, so they don't really want to talk about any real-world Liberation Front stuff; they just want to play the make-believe exercise with us. If we ask her about the ideology, she thinks that the main advantage of the Liberation Front is that it does not have one main ideology. So let's not think that means there must be a clear balance of power. And here I could scare her, but I would try to not tell her that if that balance of power would be disturbed, if one of the leaders would be put in jail, the balance of power would be disturbed. And yeah, she agrees with that. So our empathy here is raising even more. So this is us going through basically all the options on the equity exercise.

[00:06:22] Let's try to change it now. We know she doesn't like Reed and his capitalist views, and we know she has left-leaning views. So let's try to make her see the world through his eyes and go for the "Absolute Freedom" exercise itself. Again, those are the options. "What sort of personality would the leader be like?" And she tells us it would be a "narcissistic know-it-all, gazing, disgusted at the leaders, the rabble from this ivory tower." I think you're talking about yourself right now, but let's try to raise your empathy that a certain person would just prefer the Front. Again, we'll go through all the options as much as we can and try to decide which one of these will raise either fear or empathy and try to stick to your strategy. This implies you perfectly read the suspect and their ideological view.

[00:07:22] And let's try to see if she's willing to critique Damascus. Again, keep going through the options. Again, when you play, I suggest you actually read all these. Now, I'm just fishing for empathy builders or fear builders. So at this point, we've been with Anomaly through the Marxist exercise, we've been with her through the anarcho-liberal exercise, and she's not willing to do anything. I think she needs more of a reason to give us one of the others.

[00:08:00] Let's switch over to Damascus. We want him as a business expert, we want him as an operations manager, and he's leading the "Stateless Private Property" and "Dedicated to Self-Ownership" exercise. And he's on board with that. Again, go through the options; try to find those stat builders wherever you can. Let's see what he thinks the ideology is: "freedom." He doesn't want to talk about any real-world stuff with us. And when we ask him about Anomaly, now that we've raised our empathy with him, he tells us they "had an intimate relationship." He laughs as you have to think about that. "What's your connection to Damascus?" He claims, "You had sex in Saigon." And she's very angry at that. Okay, so let's see if now he's going to give up Reed. And she is. She tells us that the Front "does some good stuff, but, you know, greed is perverting the Front." So she's willing to sign a confession incriminating Damascus Reed. So we have Reed. Now we can basically charge Reed. That's just one; we need all three of them to end this episode, right? Sure enough, confessed and told.

[00:09:48] Okay, let's change the exercise. So we only have Reed. Anomaly confessed about Reed. We need Reed to confess about someone else. We go to Anomaly; she's already given him up, right? And she won't give up anyone else. So let's see, can we make Reed give up? Let's try to make him give up Bennett or Anomaly. So let's go with, where is it? "Perfect Equity." Anomaly agreed. Again, go through these options the best you can. Nothing here. So he's not willing to give up Anomaly; he's keeping his cards close. Let's change the exercise. Let's go with "Burning Down the World," "Total Cleansing," something that, for example, the priest in Episode 4 believed, right? He says that "some crazy idea." But, you know, we just want to raise his empathy. So when we asked him what sort of connections would the sort of leader that wants to bring down the apocalypse would need to have, he would need to "keep his people close, keep them angry, keep them scared." Well, that sounds like that group could be easily turned against you. And he says, "Yeah, you need to keep them occupied." So at this point, he's probably talking about what we haven't talked about yet. Yeah, so let's keep exploring our options with Damascus. So try to go through all the options. When people would get angry, they would probably get angry at "the rich," usual answer. Okay.

[00:11:51] And here we want to go with this one thing he says, "We're probably right." I don't know if our empathy or our fear with him are high enough to give us anyone. Keep in mind, if you're clicking like this, you might hit many traps. This is a risk you have to take. I know what I'm clicking on, so you have to be careful not to hit any traps. Let's see who's willing to give up anyone. So let's move over to James Bennett.

[00:12:30] So the strategy is: with each one, you want to raise your stats as far as possible by switching through the different exercises, trying to go through the exercise that you believe they empathize with first, and then the one that is politically opposed to their natural views. So with Anomaly, it was going through Equity, then through Anarcho-Liberalism. With Bennett, we went through Anarcho-Liberalism, we tried Equity, we saw nothing worked, but we saw that he had some stronger opinions when we talked about the apocalyptic cell.

[00:13:00] So let's go to James Bennett. We want you to consult us as a military expert, and you are the commander of the Front. "Yes, sir." "And you will lead." Let's go with we want someone to give up Anomaly, so we will go with "Perfect Equity." Again, go through the options as best you can. And he says, with the corners of their lips slightly lifted, "Giving speeches, talking too much, delegating irresponsibly." So he doesn't really like the sort of Anomaly style. Okay, I agree. Let's agree with him. So he might be willing to give up Anomaly. "A culture of total acceptance from Anomaly," and he's very angry about that. So he's the one that can give us Anomaly. If our empathy with him is high, we just want to make sure that we get his empathy. He says that the ideology of the Front is useless. Well, it's probably useful cover. He says, "That's a mistake." Okay. And he really doesn't like Anomaly and her ideological debates. "Would you give her up?" He says, "Why would I give anything up to someone that has never sacrificed anything?" Well, we sacrificed quite a lot of things, but we don't really want to admit that to him.

[00:14:48] Let's change the exercise and go for the apocalyptic one with him. And let's see if you can give us anything. And he says a leader of this sort of cell would need "real skills, hard hands-on experience. You need to be well trained. I think most people lack, most youth today lack." So probably he believes society has made us all weak. Yes, he does. He says, "My boys spend weeks in the forest alone to become hard and strong-willed." If you go back to Reed and we talked to him about that, let's see what he believes about that. He says that it's "[__]," and yes, it does, it's "f***ing." Let's see if he's willing to give up Bennett. Not really, although we can say Bennett is a monster. He's not willing to give him up. I suggested so we probably need more from him, right? We need to raise his empathy a bit more. Go through all his options here. Let's tell him that Anomaly already confessed. He has nothing to lose. And yeah, he's willing to give up Bennett. So at this point, we have Reed himself, we have Bennett, and now we just need Anomaly, and probably James. So Anomaly has already confessed. We've sacrificed a lot. He's not willing to give us Anomaly yet, right? So we have to go through these options and raise his empathy. Let's see if he has anything to tell us again about any of these things. He says hope would be a driving motivator for the apocalyptic cell. "What did he mean by that?" "Stripping us of all confidence." "Yes, time is the apex predator mankind faces." Let's see if now he's willing... Not yet. Okay, I need more time. Be careful with these things, there are many traps here. This is something you have to bear in mind that just clicking like this, if you don't know what you're doing, will be very hard. But I'm just telling you the general areas you would need to discuss with them. Still not enough.

[00:17:36] Let's change the exercise. Go for the Equity one again. Let's see if we have anything that could possibly help us. And let's talk about Anomaly. She tells us that she's "planning her ideology, diluting the Front." That's what we can tell him. He agrees. And let's tell him that's about to do the Front a lot of harm. He agrees with that. "Can you give her up to me?" "Yes, you can." Thank you very much.

[00:18:13] So this is how you finish Episode 10. Now be careful, there are many traps in many places, so if you don't know what you're doing, don't just go around clicking on anything. The main thing to keep in mind is, first of all, you want to take them to the exercise that you think they most empathize with. Secondly, you want to take them to the opposite exercise. For example, you want to take Anomaly through the Equity one, then through the Anarcho-Liberal one. And for each of them, you need to find not just an ideological contrast between the two leaders, you need to find a personal conflict or personal distrust. For example, Reed really doesn't like the fact that Bennett treats his children in such a cruel way, so he has a personal reason to dislike Bennett after we've shown him all the ideological reasons that they're incompatible, right? So find the personal reason and an ideological reason by going through at least those two exercises: the one they empathize with the most in your opinion, and the complete opposite one, right? So that's the strategy that should help you win Episode 10. This is a very hard episode, but it's untimed, so take your time, read through the dialogues. There are many other ways to finish this episode, much more fast and efficient than I did it here, so try to get there and discover your own. Thank you very much.
