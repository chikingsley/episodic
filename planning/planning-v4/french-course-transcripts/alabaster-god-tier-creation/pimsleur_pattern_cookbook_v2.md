## Combination & Learning Rules

### RULE 1: Touch Points

Every new item needs a minimum of 3 touches: 1) Introduction, 2) Practice in a different context, and 3) Review/retrieval check.

### RULE 2: Cognitive Load

Never introduce more than two completely new concepts before practicing them.

### RULE 3: The 7±2 Rule

Keep the number of active vocabulary items or concepts in working memory between 5 and 9 at any given time.

### RULE 4: Spiral Return (Spaced Repetition)

Items from 2-3 lessons ago should reappear in the current lesson. Review material at increasing intervals to enhance long-term retention.

### RULE 5: Context Expansion

The same grammatical structure should appear in at least two different contexts to ensure flexible understanding.

### RULE 6: Progressive Complexity

Introduce new concepts in their simplest form first, adding complexity gradually in subsequent touches (e.g., "I eat" → "I eat an apple" → "I ate an apple yesterday").

### RULE 7: Contextual Reinforcement

Practice new vocabulary and structures in multiple, varied scenarios to reinforce understanding (e.g., use "apple" when ordering food, describing breakfast, and talking about likes).

### RULE 8: Positive Reinforcement

Provide positive feedback and encouragement after successful practice or retrieval (e.g., "Very good! Now let's try another one.").

### RULE 9: Error Correction

Correct errors immediately and have the learner repeat the correct form to reinforce it.

### RULE 10: Gradual Release

Start with heavily guided practice, then gradually reduce prompts to encourage independent use of the language.

### RULE 11: Active Recall

Prioritize prompts that require the learner to actively retrieve information from memory (e.g., "How do you say...") over passive recognition.

### RULE 12: Interleaving

Mix different topics and grammar points within a single practice session to improve learning and prevent rote memorization.

### RULE 13: Personalization

Encourage learners to adapt model sentences to reflect their own lives, experiences, and preferences.

### RULE 14: Authentic Input

Use authentic language, real-life scenarios, idiomatic expressions, and cultural notes whenever possible to make the learning experience more engaging.
