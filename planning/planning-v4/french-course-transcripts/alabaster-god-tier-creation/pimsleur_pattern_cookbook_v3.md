# The Comprehensive Pimsleur Pattern Cookbook

This cookbook provides a structured set of patterns and rules for creating effective, Pimsleur-style language lessons. It focuses on immersion, spaced repetition, contextual learning, and building conversational confidence.

## Opening Patterns

### PATTERN 001: Cold_Conversation_Open

**When to use:** Starting a lesson with immediate immersion to set the context.

```markdown
[CONVERSATION_2_SPEAKERS]
[NARRATOR]: Listen to this conversation.
[CONVERSATION_2_SPEAKERS_REPEAT]
[BREAKDOWN_KEY_PHRASE]
[NARRATOR]: Listen to the conversation again.
[CONVERSATION_2_SPEAKERS_FINAL]
```

**Example:** A lesson opens with a short dialogue between two native speakers in a café. The narrator then breaks down the key phrase, "I would like a coffee."

---

### PATTERN 002: No_Conversation_Direct_Start

**When to use:** When the lesson's focus is on direct instruction or announcements from the start.

```markdown
[NARRATOR]: This is Unit [NUMBER] of Pimsleur's [LANGUAGE].
[NATIVE_NARRATOR]: [ANNOUNCEMENT_IN_TARGET_LANGUAGE]
[NARRATOR]: Starting with this lesson, you'll receive more instructions in [LANGUAGE].
```

**Example:** Lesson 22 announces, "Pas de conversation dans cette leçon," signaling a shift to more direct instruction.

---

### PATTERN 003: Review_Cascade_Open

**When to use:** Beginning a lesson with a rapid-fire review of previously learned material, building from simple to more complex phrases.

```markdown
[GREETING_IN_TARGET]
[INSTRUCTION]: Ask me how I am.
[RESPONSE]
[INSTRUCTION]: Tell me that you are [NATIONALITY].
[RESPONSE]
[INSTRUCTION]: Now say that you understand a little.
[RESPONSE]
```

**Example:** A lesson begins by having the learner rapidly recall and produce a series of phrases learned in previous units.

## Teaching Patterns

### PATTERN 004: Backward_Buildup

**When to use:** Introducing new, complex, or multi-syllable words by breaking them down from the end.

```markdown
[NARRATOR]: The word for [ENGLISH] is [TARGET_WORD]. Listen and repeat.
[SPEAKER]: [TARGET_WORD]
[SPEAKER]: [FINAL_SYLLABLE]
[SPEAKER]: [PENULTIMATE_PLUS_FINAL_SYLLABLE]
[SPEAKER]: [FULL_TARGET_WORD]
```

**Example:** To teach "Enchanté" (pleased to meet you), the breakdown is: "té" → "chanté" → "Enchanté".

---

### PATTERN 005: Substitution_Drill

**When to use:** Teaching grammatical variations of a base sentence structure by substituting key words (nouns, verbs, adjectives).

```markdown
[INSTRUCTION]: Say, "[BASE_PHRASE]."
[RESPONSE]: [BASE_PHRASE]
[INSTRUCTION]: Now, change [WORD_1] to [WORD_2].
[RESPONSE]: [MODIFIED_PHRASE]
```

**Example:** "I have a car" (`J'ai une voiture`) → "I have a *French* car" (`J'ai une voiture française`) → "*We* have a French car" (`Nous avons une voiture française`).

---

### PATTERN 006: Gender_Article_Drill

**When to use:** Teaching and reinforcing the gender of nouns and their corresponding articles (definite, indefinite, possessive).

```markdown
[NARRATOR]: The word for car is "voiture". Is it "le" or "la voiture"?
[LEARNER_RESPONSE]: La voiture.
[NARRATOR]: Correct. Now say "my car".
[LEARNER_RESPONSE]: Ma voiture.
[NARRATOR]: And "a car"?
[LEARNER_RESPONSE]: Une voiture.
```

---

### PATTERN 007: Negation_Transform

**When to use:** Teaching how to form negative sentences by transforming an affirmative statement.

```markdown
[INSTRUCTION]: Say, "[POSITIVE_STATEMENT]."
[RESPONSE]: [POSITIVE_STATEMENT]
[INSTRUCTION]: Now, say that it is *not* [POSITIVE_STATEMENT].
[RESPONSE]: [NEGATIVE_STATEMENT]
```

**Example:** "She is tall" (`Elle est grande`) → "She is not tall" (`Elle n'est pas grande`).

---

### PATTERN 020: Pronunciation_Focus

**When to use:** Isolating and practicing a particularly difficult or important sound in the target language.

```markdown
[NARRATOR]: Pay special attention to the pronunciation of the French "u" sound, as in "tu."
[SPEAKER]: tu
[BREAKDOWN_OF_SOUNDS]: It is pronounced with rounded lips, like saying "ee" while whistling.
[PRACTICE_WITH_MINIMAL_PAIRS]: Now, compare "tu" (you) with "tout" (all).
[SPEAKER]: tu... tout...
```

---

### PATTERN 021: Grammar_Explicit_Rule

**When to use:** Briefly and clearly stating a fundamental grammar rule after the learner has already been implicitly exposed to it.

```markdown
[NARRATOR]: Here's an important grammar rule about forming plural nouns in French.
[GRAMMAR_RULE_EXPLANATION]: Most nouns form their plural by adding an "s". This "s" is usually not pronounced.
[EXAMPLE_APPLICATION]: Singular: "un livre" (a book). Plural: "des livres" (books).
[PRACTICE_EXERCISE]: How would you say "pencils"? "un crayon" becomes... "des crayons".
```

---

### PATTERN 028: Situational_Vocabulary_Burst

**When to use:** Introducing a small cluster of thematically related vocabulary needed for an upcoming scenario.

```markdown
[NARRATOR]: Here are some words you'll need for ordering in a restaurant.
[SPEAKER]: The menu... le menu.
[LEARNER_REPEATS]
[SPEAKER]: The main course... le plat principal.
[LEARNER_REPEATS]
[SPEAKER]: The bill... l'addition.
[LEARNER_REPEATS]
[APPLICATION_DIALOGUE]: Now, let's use these words in a dialogue.
```

## Practice & Conversation Patterns

### PATTERN 008: Question_Answer_Forced

**When to use:** Drilling question formation by prompting the learner to ask a specific question.

```markdown
[NATIVE_NARRATOR]: Demandez-moi [QUESTION_CONTENT]. (Ask me [QUESTION_CONTENT].)
[PAUSE_FOR_LEARNER]
[LEARNER_RESPONSE]: [QUESTION_IN_TARGET_LANGUAGE]
[NATIVE_NARRATOR]: [ANSWERS_THE_QUESTION]
```

**Example:** "Ask me how many children I have." → Learner asks, "Combien d'enfants avez-vous?"

---

### PATTERN 010: Context_Switch_Practice

**When to use:** Reinforcing a grammatical structure by having the learner apply it to several different (but similar) contexts.

```markdown
[INSTRUCTION]: Say, "My family is in America."
[RESPONSE_1]
[INSTRUCTION]: Now say, "My family is in France."
[RESPONSE_2]
[INSTRUCTION]: Now say, "She is with me."
[RESPONSE_3]
```

---

### PATTERN 013: Guided_Roleplay

**When to use:** Practicing a semi-structured conversation where the narrator guides the learner's side of the dialogue.

```markdown
[SETUP_SCENARIO]: Imagine you're at a train station. I'll play the agent.
[NATIVE_SPEAKER]: Bonjour, je peux vous aider? (Hello, can I help you?)
[INSTRUCTION_TO_LEARNER]: Ask when the next train to Paris leaves.
[LEARNER_RESPONSE]
[NATIVE_SPEAKER]: [FOLLOW_UP_RESPONSE]
```

---

### PATTERN 029: Contextual_Dialogue_Practice

**When to use:** A comprehensive pattern for practicing language in a specific, realistic context from start to finish.

```markdown
[SETUP_CONTEXT]: Imagine you're in a restaurant in France.
[INTRODUCE_RELEVANT_VOCABULARY] (using PATTERN 028)
[MODEL_DIALOGUE]
[PRACTICE_DIALOGUE_WITH_LEARNER] (using PATTERN 013)
[CULTURAL_NOTE_IF_APPLICABLE] (using PATTERN 036)
[VARIATION_DRILL] (using PATTERN 005)
```

---

### PATTERN 034: Dialogue_Reconstruction

**When to use:** To reinforce comprehension and active recall of a full dialogue.

```markdown
[NARRATOR]: Listen carefully to the following dialogue.
[FULL_DIALOGUE_IS_PLAYED]
[NARRATOR]: Now, let's reconstruct it. You'll take the part of the customer.
[SPEAKER_1]: (Plays the waiter's first line)
[PAUSE_FOR_LEARNER_TO_PROVIDE_THE_CUSTOMER'S_LINE]
[SPEAKER_2]: (Confirms/corrects the customer's line, then provides the next waiter line)
[CONTINUE_UNTIL_DIALOGUE_IS_COMPLETE]
```

## Number, Time & Counting Patterns

### PATTERN 011: Complex_Number_Introduction

**When to use:** Teaching compound numbers by breaking them into their constituent parts.

```markdown
[NARRATOR]: The number 70 in French is "soixante-dix".
[SPEAKER]: soixante-dix
[NARRATOR]: Do you recognize the parts? It's literally "sixty-ten".
[SPEAKER]: soixante... dix... soixante-dix.
```

---

### PATTERN 030: Time_Telling_Practice

**When to use:** Teaching and drilling how to tell time.

```markdown
[NARRATOR]: Let's practice telling time. How do you say 3:15?
[PAUSE_FOR_LEARNER]
[SPEAKER]: Il est trois heures et quart.
[NARRATOR]: Now, how about 4:30?
[PAUSE_FOR_LEARNER]
[SPEAKER]: Il est quatre heures et demie.
```

## Review & Reinforcement Patterns

### PATTERN 015: Spaced_Retrieval_Check

**When to use:** Checking retention of material from previous lessons by prompting recall from English.

```markdown
[NATIVE_NARRATOR]: Comment dit-on "[ENGLISH_PHRASE]" en français? (How does one say...)
[PAUSE_FOR_RETRIEVAL]
[SPEAKER]: [FRENCH_PHRASE]
```

---

### PATTERN 016: Error_Anticipation_Correct

**When to use:** Proactively addressing a common learner error by contrasting the correct and incorrect forms.

```markdown
[NARRATOR]: A common mistake is to confuse [WORD_A] and [WORD_B].
[NARRATOR]: Remember, for [CONTEXT_1], you say [CORRECT_FORM].
[PRACTICE_CORRECT_FORM]
```

**Example:** Correcting the use of "Je suis" for age ("I am 30") and reinforcing the correct form, "J'ai 30 ans" ("I have 30 years").

---

### PATTERN 032: Flashback_Review

**When to use:** Explicitly reviewing a key concept from several lessons prior before applying it in a new context.

```markdown
[NARRATOR]: Remember in Lesson 5 when we learned how to say "I would like"?
[SPEAKER]: Je voudrais...
[LEARNER_REPEATS]
[NARRATOR]: Now, use that to order a coffee.
[LEARNER_RESPONSE]: Je voudrais un café.
```

---

### PATTERN 035: Listening_Comprehension_Test

**When to use:** To assess comprehension by playing a dialogue and then asking questions about it.

```markdown
[NARRATOR]: Listen to the following dialogue.
[DIALOGUE_IS_PLAYED]
[NARRATOR]: Now, answer the following question in French.
[QUESTION_ABOUT_DIALOGUE_CONTENT]
[PAUSE_FOR_LEARNER_RESPONSE]
[CORRECT_ANSWER_IS_PROVIDED]
```

## Cultural & Closing Patterns

### PATTERN 036: Cultural_Immersion_Snippet

**When to use:** To provide brief, relevant cultural insights that give context to the language.

```markdown
[NARRATOR]: Here's a cultural note about dining in France.
[CULTURAL_INFORMATION]: Meals are often longer and more social events. It's common to spend several hours at the dinner table.
[EXAMPLE_PHRASE]: A useful phrase is "Prenez votre temps," meaning "Take your time."
```

---

### PATTERN 017: Practical_Application_Close

**When to use:** Ending a lesson with a final, realistic dialogue that uses the material taught in the unit.

```markdown
[NARRATOR]: To finish today's lesson, listen to this exchange.
[FINAL_REALISTIC_DIALOGUE_IS_PLAYED]
[NARRATOR]: This is the end of Unit [NUMBER].
```

---

### PATTERN 033: Preview_Next_Lesson_Close

**When to use:** Building anticipation and providing a smooth transition by teasing the next lesson's topic.

```markdown
[NARRATOR]: This is the end of today's lesson. In our next unit, we'll learn about making plans for the future.
[TEASER_EXAMPLE]: For example, you'll learn to say, "Demain, nous irons au cinéma." (Tomorrow, we will go to the cinema.)
[NARRATOR]: Until next time!
```

## Core Combination Rules

These rules govern how patterns are combined to manage cognitive load and maximize retention.

1. **Touch Points:** Every new vocabulary or grammar item needs at least three "touches": 1) Introduction, 2) Practice in a new context, and 3) a Review/Retrieval check later on.
2. **Cognitive Load (2-Item Rule):** Never introduce more than two completely new concepts (e.g., a new verb tense and a new set of vocabulary) before stopping to practice and consolidate them.
3. **Working Memory (The 7±2 Rule):** Keep the number of *active* new vocabulary items being drilled at any one time between 5 and 9 to avoid overwhelming short-term memory.
4. **Progressive Complexity:** Introduce new concepts in their simplest form first. Gradually add layers of complexity in subsequent touches (e.g., "I eat" → "I eat an apple" → "I ate an apple yesterday").
5. **Contextual Reinforcement:** New structures and vocabulary must be practiced in at least two different, meaningful contexts to ensure flexible, real-world understanding.
6. **Spaced Repetition & Spiral Return:** Material must be reviewed at increasing intervals. Items from 2-3 lessons ago should reappear in the current lesson to be pushed into long-term memory.
7. **Positive Reinforcement & Error Correction:** Provide immediate, encouraging feedback. Correct errors gently by stating the correct form and having the learner repeat it, creating a positive feedback loop.
8. **Gradual Release:** Start with heavy guidance (e.g., "Repeat after me...") and gradually reduce prompts ("How do you say...?"), moving toward open-ended questions that encourage independent language use.
9. **Active Recall:** Prioritize prompts that force the learner to retrieve information from memory ("How do you say X?") over passive recognition ("Does Y mean Z?").
10. **Personalization:** Whenever possible, encourage learners to adapt model sentences to their own lives (e.g., after practicing "I have two children," ask "And you, how many children do you have?").
