### Answering Your Core Questions

* Pacing & Time: With ~75 total lessons, if a user does one 20-30 minute lesson per day, they complete the entire A0-A2 curriculum in ~10-11 weeks. This aligns perfectly with the "90 hours or X weeks" figures you found. A dedicated learner doing two lessons a day could finish in about 6 weeks. The structure supports both casual and intensive learning.
* Lesson Length: A single "lesson" is a 15-minute Pimsleur-style core audio. The extra 15 minutes come from optional, gamified drills: vocabulary flashcards, speaking practice on key phrases, and short "fill-the-gap" exercises for the grammar. This bridges the gap you identified: short, digestible lessons for the TikTok generation, with optional deeper practice for the dedicated student.
* Does it cover everything? Yes. By using real-world conversational goals, we organically cover the necessary grammar and vocabulary from Duolingo, Pimsleur, and Kwiziq. For example, Duolingo's "Paris" unit from Section 4 is covered in our "Navigating the City" and "Travel Stories" units. "Shop for clothes" is covered in our "What Happened Yesterday" unit (I bought a hat...). We don't need a separate unit for every noun category; we integrate them into the actions people actually perform.
