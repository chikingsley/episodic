## Combination Rules

### RULE 1: Touch Points

Every new item needs minimum 3 touches:

1. Introduction
2. Practice in different context
3. Review/retrieval check

### RULE 2: Cognitive Load

Never introduce more than 2 completely new concepts before practicing

### RULE 3: The 7±2 Rule

Keep active vocabulary items between 5-9 in working memory

### RULE 4: Spiral Return

Items from 2-3 lessons ago should appear in current lesson

### RULE 5: Context Expansion

Same structure should appear in at least 2 different contexts

### RULE 6: Progressive Complexity

New concepts should be introduced in their simplest form first, with complexity added gradually in subsequent touches.

**Example:**

1. Introduction: Teach "Je mange" (I eat) as a simple present tense statement.
2. First variation: Add an object, "Je mange une pomme" (I eat an apple).
3. Second variation: Change to past tense, "J'ai mangé une pomme" (I ate an apple).
4. Third variation: Add time reference, "J'ai mangé une pomme hier" (I ate an apple yesterday).

### RULE 7: Contextual Reinforcement

New vocabulary and structures should be practiced in multiple contexts and with varied examples to reinforce understanding and retention.

**Example:**

- First context: Ordering food in a restaurant.
  - "Je voudrais une pomme." (I would like an apple.)
- Second context: Describing what you ate for breakfast.
  - "J'ai mangé une pomme ce matin." (I ate an apple this morning.)
- Third context: Talking about fruits you like.
  - "J'aime les pommes." (I like apples.)

### RULE 8: Positive Reinforcement

Provide positive feedback and encouragement after successful practice or retrieval.

**Example:**

- Narrator: "Very good! 'J'ai mangé une pomme.' Now let's try another one."
- After correct response: "Excellent! You're doing great!"

### RULE 9: Error Correction

Correct errors immediately and have the learner repeat the correct form.

**Example:**

- Learner says: "Je suis mangé une pomme." (Incorrect use of être instead of avoir for past tense)
- Correction: "No, in French we say 'J'ai mangé une pomme.' Please repeat after me: 'J'ai mangé une pomme.'"
- Learner repeats the correct form.

### RULE 10: Gradual Release

Start with guided practice where the learner is prompted heavily, then gradually reduce prompts to encourage independent use of the language.

**Example:**

1. Guided practice:
   - Narrator: "Now tell me you ate an apple. Say 'J'ai mangé...'"
   - Learner: "J'ai mangé une pomme."
2. Semi-guided practice:
   - Narrator: "Now tell me you ate an apple."
   - Learner: "J'ai mangé une pomme."
3. Independent practice:
   - Narrator: "What did you eat for breakfast?"
   - Learner: "J'ai mangé une pomme ce matin."

---

## Additional Rules

### RULE 11: Spaced Repetition

Review material at increasing intervals to enhance long-term retention.

**Example:**

- Lesson 1: Introduce "Je m'appelle" (My name is)
- Lesson 2: Review "Je m'appelle" and introduce "Comment vous appelez-vous?" (What is your name?)
- Lesson 5: Review name phrases in a new context (e.g., introducing someone else)
- Lesson 10: Review all name-related phrases in a conversation about meeting new people

### RULE 12: Active Recall

Encourage learners to actively retrieve information from memory rather than passively recognizing it.

**Example:**

- Instead of showing the French word and asking for the English equivalent, ask learners to produce the French word when given the English.
- Use prompts like "Comment dit-on '[English phrase]' en français?" (How do you say '[English phrase]' in French?)

### RULE 13: Interleaving

Mix different topics and grammar points within a single practice session to improve learning and retention.

**Example:**

- Practice a sequence that includes:
  1. A question about the time ("Quelle heure est-il?")
  2. A statement about what you ate for breakfast ("J'ai mangé des céréales.")
  3. A question about someone's nationality ("Vous êtes américain?")
  4. A statement about what you're going to do tomorrow ("Demain, je vais travailler.")

### RULE 14: Personalization

Encourage learners to personalize the language by talking about their own experiences, preferences, and plans.

**Example:**

- Instead of always repeating model sentences, ask learners to adapt sentences to reflect their own lives.
  - Model: "J'ai deux enfants."
  - Personalized: "J'ai un enfant." (if the learner has one child) or "Je n'ai pas d'enfants." (if the learner has no children)

### RULE 15: Authentic Input

Use authentic language and cultural context whenever possible.

**Example:**

- Use real-life scenarios, idiomatic expressions, and cultural notes to make the language learning experience more authentic and engaging.
- Teach learners how to order coffee in a café with common variations (e.g., "un café, s'il vous plaît" vs. "un café crème, s'il vous plaît").

## Example Lesson Structure Using Patterns

Here's an example of how these patterns and rules might be combined to create a Pimsleur-style lesson:

1. **Opening:**
   - Use PATTERN 001 (Cold_Conversation_Open) to start with a dialogue about ordering food in a café.

2. **Review:**
   - Use PATTERN 003 (Review_Cascade_Open) to review greetings and basic phrases from previous lessons.
   - Apply RULE 4 (Spiral Return) by including phrases from 2-3 lessons ago.

3. **New Material:**
   - Use PATTERN 004 (Backward_Buildup) to introduce a new word, like "déjeuner" (lunch).
   - Use PATTERN 028 (Situational_Vocabulary_Burst) to introduce vocabulary related to ordering lunch.
   - Apply RULE 2 (Cognitive Load) by introducing only 2-3 new words or phrases before practicing.

4. **Practice:**
   - Use PATTERN 029 (Contextual_Dialogue_Practice) to practice ordering lunch in a café.
   - Use PATTERN 026 (Sentence_Transformation_Drill) to practice transforming statements into questions (e.g., "Je prends une salade." → "Qu'est-ce que vous prenez?").
   - Use PATTERN 010 (Context_Switch_Practice) to practice the new vocabulary in different contexts (e.g., talking about what you had for lunch yesterday, what you'll have for lunch tomorrow).

5. **Review and Reinforcement:**
   - Use PATTERN 015 (Spaced_Retrieval_Check) to review phrases from earlier in the lesson and previous lessons.
   - Apply RULE 1 (Touch Points) by ensuring each new item has been introduced, practiced in context, and reviewed.

6. **Closing:**
   - Use PATTERN 033 (Preview_Next_Lesson_Close) to give a preview of the next lesson's topic (e.g., making dinner plans).

## Additional Examples for New Patterns

Let's provide more detailed examples for some of the new patterns we've introduced:

### PATTERN 020: Pronunciation_Focus Example

```markdown
[NARRATOR]: Pay special attention to the pronunciation of the French "u" sound, as in "tu."
[SPEAKER]: tu (you)
[BREAKDOWN_OF_SOUNDS]:
- The French "u" is pronounced with rounded lips, somewhat like saying "ee" while whistling.
- It's different from the English "oo" sound in "food."
[PRACTICE_WITH_MINIMAL_PAIRS]:
- Compare "tu" (you) with "tout" (all), "sur" (on), and "lune" (moon).
[SPEAKER]: tu, tout, sur, lune
[LEARNER_REPEATS]
[APPLICATION]:
- Practice saying "Tu es sur la lune." (You are on the moon.)
```

### PATTERN 021: Grammar_Explicit_Rule Example

```markdown
[NARRATOR]: Here's an important grammar rule about forming plural nouns in French.
[GRAMMAR_RULE_EXPLANATION]:
- Most French nouns form their plural by adding an "s" to the singular form.
- However, this "s" is usually not pronounced unless it's part of a liaison.
[EXAMPLE_APPLICATION]:
- Singular: "un livre" (a book)
- Plural: "des livres" (books)
[PRACTICE_EXERCISE]:
1. "un crayon" → "des crayons" (pencils)
2. "une table" → "des tables" (tables)
3. "un ami" → "des amis" (friends)
```

### PATTERN 025: Verb_Conjugation_Drill Example

```markdown

[SPEAKER]: je parle (I speak)
[LEARNER_REPEATS]
[SPEAKER]: tu parles (you speak)
[LEARNER_REPEATS]
[SPEAKER]: il/elle parle (he/she speaks)
