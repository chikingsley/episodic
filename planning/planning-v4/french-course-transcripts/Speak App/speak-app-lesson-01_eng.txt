Bravo! With the Speak Method, you learn French intuitively through speaking. So, welcome to our Beginning French Course! If you're ready to go, say "on y va"!

All right. Let's start with a classic French greeting. "Bonjour!" Literal translation: "good day." But it basically means hello. A little tip for this word. O-N makes the sound, "ong" bon-jour. Bonjour! Give it a try. 

[Prompter]
Bonjour. 

[Student]
Bonjour.

Wow! Off to a great start. Okay, picture yourself on a plane to Paris. You sit down next to a French speaker. "Bonjour!" Now, you want to introduce yourself. What do you say? "Je m'appelle"? No! Too textbooky. Here's what I would say... "Moi, c'est Noémie." I'm Noémie. Technically, "moi" means "me" and "c'est" means "it is." Notice how E-S-T makes the /e/ in "c'est"? weird... I know, but it's just one of those things you'll naturally get used to. Anyway, you can use this expression to introduce yourself in a natural, casual way. "Moi, c'est Noémie." Try that out. 

[Prompter]
Moi, c'est...

[Student]
Moi, c'est...

Super. Great. At Speak, we teach you French that people actually use, so that you sound like a native speaker from day one. So, how would a French speaker respond to this? Let's speak a French name like, hmm, Philippe. "Philippe, enchanté." Philippe, nice to meet you." Short and sweet. "Philippe, enchanté." Let's practice. 

[Prompter]
Philippe, enchanté. 

[Student]
Philippe, enchanté.

Bravo! Great job! Okay, moving on. Imagine you want to get to know Philippe a little better. You can ask him this... "Vous vivez à Paris?" Do you live in Paris? "Vous" is the formal word for "you" that we use with strangers. So, it's technically, "You live in Paris?" Also, did you notice that the letters S, Z, and S aren't pronounced? "Vous vivez à Paris?" I know. We have a lot of silent letters in French. It can get a little confusing, so for now, we'll write them like this. "Vous vivez à Paris?" Give that a try. 

[Prompter]
Vous vivez. 

[Student]

Nice job. Now, if he does live in Paris, you might say, "Oui, et vous?" Literally, "Yes, and you?" But think of it like, "Yes, how about you?" "Oui, et vous?" If he doesn't live in Paris, he might say, "Non, à Nice." This "non" rhymes with "bon," like "bonjour." "No, à Nice." Beautiful city, by the way. Ready? Let's give it a go. 

[Prompter]

Bravo! Now, you're going to hear a question like, "Vous vivez à Paris?" Your job is to answer using the response that we gave you. So if you read, "Yes, how about you?" You'll say, "Oui. Et vous?" All right, here we go!
