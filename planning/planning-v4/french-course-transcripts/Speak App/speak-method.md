# The Speak Method

The Speak Method is designed to help you confidently use real, conversational French in everyday situations. The approach is structured in three main steps:

1. Learn authentic French phrases  
   - Focus on language that native speakers actually use, not just textbook examples.

2. Practice with interactive speaking exercises  
   - Use speaking drills and tricks to reinforce new phrases and build fluency.

3. Apply your skills in realistic scenarios  
   - Role play with AI as a customer, traveler, or in other real-life contexts.
   - Step outside your comfort zone, make mistakes, and learn from them in a supportive environment.
   - Receive real-time feedback to help you improve.

By following this method, you will:

- Speak over 120 words in your first few lessons.
- Build up to nearly a thousand phrases within your first week.
- Quickly sound more natural and confident in French.
