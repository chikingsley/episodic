# Analysis: Speak vs Pimsleur French Language Programs

## Does Pimsleur Cover Speak's Content? (And When?)

This analysis breaks down the content from the Speak course and identifies when and how the equivalent concept appears in the Pimsleur French program (Levels I-V).

### Introductions

**Moi, c'est Lisa.**

- **Speak's Approach:** Casual, common self-introduction taught in Unit 1
- **Pimsleur's Equivalent:** `Je suis américain.` (French I, Lesson 3)
- **Analysis:** Pimsleur teaches the standard grammatical form (`Je suis`). It **never** teaches the `Moi, c'est...` construction, representing a key difference in register.

### Greetings

**Salut / Coucou**

- **Speak's Approach:** Core informal greetings taught in Unit 1
- **Pimsleur's Equivalent:** **Yes, but much later.** `Salut` appears in French II, Lesson 9. `Coucou` doesn't appear until French V, Lesson 20.
- **Analysis:** Speak prioritizes these casual, high-frequency terms for immediate use. Pimsleur reserves them for more advanced levels, focusing only on the formal `Bonjour` in Level I.

**Comment ça va?**

- **Speak's Approach:** The primary, informal "how are you?" taught in Unit 1
- **Pimsleur's Equivalent:** `Comment allez-vous?` (French I, Lesson 2). The phrase `Ça va?` is introduced in French I, Lesson 16.
- **Analysis:** Pimsleur teaches the formal version first and foremost. It introduces `Ça va?` later, reflecting its more formal, traditional approach. Speak prioritizes the most common colloquial form.

### Politeness

**Bonne journée!**

- **Speak's Approach:** "Have a good day!" taught in Unit 2 as a polite closing
- **Pimsleur's Equivalent:** **Yes, in French III, Lesson 22**
- **Analysis:** Speak includes this essential social phrase in its initial survival kit. Pimsleur waits until a much later stage to introduce it.

### Survival Phrases

**Je cherche...**

- **Speak's Approach:** "I'm looking for..." - the core way to find things (Unit 2)
- **Pimsleur's Equivalent:** `Où est...?` (French I, Lesson 4)
- **Analysis:** Pimsleur **never teaches the verb `chercher`**. It teaches you to ask *where something is*, not that *you are looking for it*. A functional but distinct approach.

**Il y a...**

- **Speak's Approach:** "There is/are..." taught in Unit 2 for recommendations
- **Pimsleur's Equivalent:** `Il y a...` (French I, Lesson 22)
- **Analysis:** Speak introduces this immediately for its common purpose. Pimsleur introduces it much later, in the context of counting (`Il y a combien de personnes?`).

### Learning French

**J'apprends le français.**

- **Speak's Approach:** "I am learning French" - a key statement for a learner (Unit 3)
- **Pimsleur's Equivalent:** The verb `apprendre` (to learn) appears in French III, Lesson 4, within a phrase like **`le temps d'apprendre`** ("the time to learn")
- **Analysis:** Pimsleur introduces the verb, but not in the simple, direct "I am learning" structure that Speak teaches. This specific, useful phrase for a language learner is a gap in Pimsleur's early levels.

### Shopping

**Vous payez par carte? / En espèces**

- **Speak's Approach:** "Paying by card" / "In cash" taught in Unit 4
- **Pimsleur's Equivalent:** **No.** Pimsleur does not teach common payment phrases. The word `carte` appears in other contexts (e.g., a map), but the crucial phrases `par carte` and `en espèces` are absent.
- **Analysis:** This is a significant gap in Pimsleur's practical, transactional vocabulary.

**Prices (C'est 5 euros.)**

- **Speak's Approach:** Uses the modern currency, **euros**
- **Pimsleur's Equivalent:** `C'est 5 francs.`
- **Analysis:** Pimsleur's content is older and uses the pre-2002 currency, **francs**. This is a major practical difference in modernity. Speak uses the current currency.

### Expressing Likes

**J'aime la France.**

- **Speak's Approach:** Expressing likes is taught in Unit 3 to allow personal expression
- **Pimsleur's Equivalent:** `aimer` is introduced in French I, Lesson 29
- **Analysis:** A major difference in priority. Speak introduces this early. Pimsleur holds `aimer` until the second-to-last lesson of the first level, long after mastering complex tenses.

## What Speak Teaches That Pimsleur Doesn't (Or Prioritizes Differently)

This section highlights concepts, vocabulary, and priorities unique to Speak's approach compared to Pimsleur.

### Prioritization of Casual/Social Language

Speak front-loads its course with the most common, modern, and often casual phrases for immediate social use. While Pimsleur eventually covers *some* of these, it prioritizes grammatical formality first.

**Examples:** `Salut`, `Coucou`, `Moi, c'est...`, `Bonne journée!`, `Ça va?` (as the primary greeting)

### Learner-Specific Phrases

Speak includes phrases specifically useful for someone learning the language.

**Example:** `J'apprends le français.` (I am learning French)

### Modern & Practical Transactional Vocabulary

Speak's content reflects current-day realities for a traveler or person on the street.

**Examples:** Payment methods like `par carte` (by card) and `en espèces` (in cash). It also uses the modern currency, `euros`, whereas Pimsleur uses the outdated `francs`.

### Specific Verbs for Common Situations

Speak opts for verbs that are highly useful in specific survival situations, which Pimsleur's narrative-driven structure omits.

**Example:** `chercher` (to look for)

### Focus on Expressing Personal Opinion Early

Speak gives the learner the tools to express simple likes and dislikes very early on, facilitating more personal connection.

**Example:** `J'aime la France`, `J'adore le Canada!` are taught in Unit 3. Pimsleur waits until Lesson 29 to introduce `aimer`.
