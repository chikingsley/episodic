Excellent question. This gets to the very heart of the pedagogical "how."

Looking at the SPEAK data, the answer is: **Yes, absolutely, but its repetition model is fundamentally different from the other methods.** It's built on two distinct types of loops: a very strong *micro-loop* within each lesson, and a weaker, more incidental *macro-loop* across units.

Here is a breakdown of how repetition works "in the flow" of the SPEAK course.

### 1. The Intra-Lesson "Micro-Loop" (High-Frequency Repetition)

This is the most dominant form of repetition in SPEAK. Each skill-based lesson (e.g., "Greet a friend," "Order food") is a self-contained cycle of **Introduce -> Drill -> Expand -> Drill.**

**Example: Unit 1, "Greet a friend"**

1. **Introduce:** The `Video Lesson` section introduces the core phrases:
    * `Comment ça va ?`
    * `Ça va bien.`
    * `très bien`
    * `Bof.`

2. **Drill 1:** `Speaking Drill 1` immediately has you practice these exact phrases in simple combinations:
    * `Salut ! Comment ça va ?`
    * `Ça va bien, merci.`
    * `Ça va très bien.`

3. **Expand:** The `Vocab Builder` adds a new layer to the conversation, building directly on the "how are you" theme:
    * `Et la famille ?`
    * `Et les amis ?`
    * `Et le boulot ?`

4. **Drill 2:** `Speaking Drill 2` combines everything from that lesson into a slightly more complex conversational flow:
    * `Coucou ! Comment ça va ?`
    * `Ça va très bien.`
    * `Et les amis ?`
    * `Les amis, ça va bien.`

**Analysis of the "How":**
This micro-loop is designed for **situational mastery**. The goal is for you to leave that 15-minute lesson being able to handle that specific conversation. The repetition is intense but short-term. It's about drilling one block until it's solid.

### 2. The Inter-Lesson "Macro-Loop" (Incidental & Structural Repetition)

This is the more subtle repetition you're asking about—the one that happens "across the lessons." It's less about drilling specific vocabulary and more about the **natural reuse of foundational structures**.

**A. Foundational Greetings and Politeness**

These are the most consistently repeated elements because they are the entry/exit points for any conversation.

* **`Bonjour`**: Appears in Unit 1 (`Bonjour ! Moi, c'est Lisa.`) and is reused to start a new situation in Unit 4 (`Bonjour ! Un thé, s'il vous plaît.`).
* **`Merci`**: Appears in Unit 1 (`Ça va bien, merci.`) and is reused in Unit 4 (`Non, merci.`).
* **`S'il vous plaît`**: Introduced for ordering in Unit 1 and reused heavily in the same context.

**How it works:** These words are not being *re-taught*. The course assumes you've learned them and re-uses them as necessary tools to frame a new interaction.

**B. Core Grammatical Patterns**

The course repeats core sentence *structures* across units, even with completely different vocabulary. This is the most important "in the flow" repetition.

**Pattern 1: The `Vous + Verb?` Question**

* Unit 1: `**Vous vivez** à Paris ?` (Do you live...?)
* Unit 3: `**Vous parlez** français ?` (Do you speak...?)
* Unit 4: `**Vous avez** des casquettes ?` (Do you have...?)
* Unit 4: `**Vous payez** par carte ?` (Are you paying...?)

**How it works:** The course never explicitly says, "To ask a formal 'you' question, use `Vous + verb`." Instead, it has you repeat this pattern in different contexts, expecting you to absorb the structure implicitly.

**Pattern 2: The `Je + Verb` Statement**

* Unit 2: `**Je cherche** les toilettes.` (I'm looking for...)
* Unit 3: `**Je parle** anglais.` (I speak...)
* Unit 3: `**Je ne parle pas** chinois.` (I don't speak...)
* Unit 1/4: `**Je voudrais** un croissant.` (I would like...)

**How it works:** This reinforces the basic "I" statement structure, which is the backbone of expressing your needs and identity.

### What's Missing: The Contrast with Other Methods

Understanding what SPEAK *doesn't* do highlights its "how."

* **No Algorithmic Spaced Recall (Pimsleur Model):** SPEAK does not systematically pull `Vous vivez à Paris?` from Unit 1 and ask you to recall it in the middle of Unit 4 to test you. The repetition is **context-driven**, not memory-driven.
* **No Constructional Reuse (Noble/Thomas Model):** SPEAK gives you the complete phrase `Je cherche une bonne boulangerie`. It does not teach you `chercher` (to look for) as an independent "brick" and then ask you to build the sentence yourself. You are given the finished product to drill, not the raw materials to construct with.

### Conclusion

The "how" of repetition in the SPEAK course is **block-based**.

1. Each lesson is a **self-contained block** that is heavily drilled for immediate mastery (the micro-loop).
2. You carry a few **foundational tools** (like `Bonjour`, `Merci`) and **structural patterns** (like `Vous...?` and `Je...`) with you from one block to the next. This is the macro-loop.
3. However, specific vocabulary (like `une casquette` or `le boulot`) tends to stay **siloed within its situational block**. You are not systematically prompted to recall it later.

The repetition is designed to make you proficient in specific situations one at a time, assuming that the underlying sentence structures will become second nature through repeated exposure in different contexts.
