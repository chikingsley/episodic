## ANALYSIS PROMPT

You are analyzing a Pimsleur language lesson transcript to understand the pedagogical approach and vocabulary introduction strategy. Follow these instructions carefully:

### 1. IDENTIFY NEW vs. REVIEWED CONTENT

**New Vocabulary & Phrases:**

- List ONLY words/phrases being introduced for the FIRST time in this specific lesson
- Include both individual words AND longer phrases/expressions
- Look for narrator explanations like "Here's how to say..." or "This means..."
- Include numbers, time expressions, and grammatical constructions being introduced
- Format: `* [French] - [English translation]`

**Reviewed Vocabulary & Phrases:**

- List words/phrases from previous lessons being practiced again
- These are items students should already know from earlier lessons
- Include core expressions that appear in multiple lessons
- Format: `* [French] - [English translation]`

### 2. ANALYZE PRONUNCIATION INSTRUCTION

**Pronunciation Breakdowns (Back-chaining):**

- Identify words taught through back-chaining (building from end to beginning)
- Look for patterns like: "d'hui" → "aujour" → "aujourd'hui"
- Note words with special pronunciation emphasis or contrast
- Include syllable-by-syllable breakdowns shown in transcript
- Format: `* [word]: [breakdown shown] (emphasized pronunciation)`

### 3. COUNT REPETITIONS

**Phrase Repetitions:**

- Count how many times complete phrases are prompted for student repetition
- Include both narrator-led repetition and conversation practice
- Look for patterns like "Say..." or "Ask..." followed by student responses
- Count each instance where student is expected to say the full phrase
- Sort from highest to lowest count

**Word & Breakdown Repetitions:**

- Count individual words and pronunciation parts separately
- Include single words repeated in isolation
- Count syllable practice and back-chaining components
- Include contrasts and emphasis repetitions

### 4. ANALYTICAL GUIDELINES

- **Be Precise:** Only count what's actually NEW in this lesson vs. reviewed
- **Focus on Student Production:** Count times students are prompted to speak, not just listening
- **Distinguish Levels:** Separate individual words from complete phrases
- **Identify Patterns:** Note the pedagogical approach (how new items are introduced)
- **Track Complexity:** Observe how grammatical complexity builds lesson by lesson

### 5. KEY QUESTIONS TO ANSWER

- How many truly new vocabulary items are introduced? (Should be 6-10 max per lesson)
- What percentage of the lesson uses previously learned material?
- Which new items get the most repetition practice?
- How does this lesson build on previous lessons?
- What grammatical concepts are being introduced or reinforced?

### 6. QUALITY CHECKS

- **Vocabulary Load:** Pimsleur typically introduces 6-10 new items per lesson maximum
- **Review Ratio:** 60-70% of content should be reviewing previous material
- **Repetition Patterns:** New items should appear 3-8 times in various contexts
- **Pedagogical Logic:** New items should serve immediate practical conversational needs

### 7. TRANSCRIPT ANALYSIS TIPS

- Look for conversation sections to identify practical usage contexts
- Note when narrator explains expressions (indicates new content)
- Pay attention to arithmetic/drill sections for repetition counting
- Identify role-play scenarios showing vocabulary in context
- Track how lessons build thematically (time → money → family, etc.)

### OUTPUT FORMAT

Use the exact markdown template provided above. Be thorough but concise. Focus on the pedagogical strategy rather than just listing vocabulary. Your analysis should help understand how Pimsleur builds conversational competence through carefully managed cognitive load and systematic repetition.
