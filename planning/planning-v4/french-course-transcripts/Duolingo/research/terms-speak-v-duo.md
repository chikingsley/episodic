### Overall Summary

Both Duolingo and Speak have terms of service that are standard for modern US-based technology companies. They both include clauses for automatic subscription renewals, broad licenses for user content, limitations of liability, and mandatory arbitration for US users.

However, there are several key differences:

1. **AI-Specific Terms:** Speak's terms are more modern, with explicit rules regarding the output from its AI/machine learning services. Duolingo's terms are more focused on traditional user submissions like translations.
2. **User Content Rights:** Duolingo's policy is stricter, claiming exclusive **ownership** of "Activity Materials" (e.g., translations you create). Speak claims no ownership but takes a very broad license to use your content.
3. **International Users:** Speak provides a large, detailed section (Section 23) with significant, consumer-friendly derogations for users in **France and Germany**, as required by EU law. This includes local governing law, a right of withdrawal, and different liability standards. Duolingo's terms are more uniformly applied, governed by Pennsylvania law for all users.
4. **Dispute Resolution:** While both mandate arbitration for US users, Speak’s policy explicitly exempts users in France and Germany, allowing them to use their local courts.

### Detailed Thematic Comparison

Here is a breakdown of how the policies compare on specific topics.

#### 1. User Content and AI Output

* **Duolingo:**
  * **User Content License:** You grant Duolingo a "perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, nonexclusive, transferable, and sublicensable license" to use any "Content" you submit (reviews, photos, etc.).
  * **Ownership of Work:** This is a critical point. Duolingo states that "Activity Materials" (data generated from your use of educational activities, like translations) "shall be exclusively owned by Duolingo." You **assign all rights**, including intellectual property rights, for this material to Duolingo.
* **Speak:**
  * **User Content License:** Speak claims **no ownership** over your user content, stating it "is and will remain yours." However, like Duolingo, you grant Speak a very broad "royalty-free, transferable, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, and worldwide license" to use it.
  * **AI "Output":** Speak has a specific section for the output generated by its AI. You can use the Output for any lawful purpose, but Speak can force you to stop if they believe it infringes on third-party rights.
  * **AI-Specific Restriction:** Crucially, you **cannot** represent the AI Output as human-generated or use it to train your own machine learning models. This is a key difference reflecting Speak's AI focus.

**Conclusion:** Duolingo's policy is more aggressive in claiming outright ownership of the educational work you produce on the platform. Speak’s is more aligned with modern AI services, granting users broad use of the output but with specific restrictions to protect its models.

#### 2. Payments, Subscriptions, and Refunds

* **Duolingo:**
  * **Auto-Renewal:** Subscriptions auto-renew unless you terminate them in your account settings.
  * **Refunds:** The policy is very strict: "**All payments are nonrefundable**." They state there are no refunds or credits for partially used periods. Any refund is granted on a case-by-case basis at their "sole discretion."
  * **Student Plan:** Has a specific, detailed "Student Plan" with third-party verification through SheerID.
* **Speak:**
  * **Auto-Renewal:** Subscriptions auto-renew unless you cancel at least three days before the next term.
  * **Refunds:** The policy is virtually identical to Duolingo's. Refunds are not provided unless required by law, and any exception is at their "sole discretion."
  * **EU Right of Withdrawal:** For users in France and Germany, Speak's terms include the legally required 14-day right of withdrawal for consumers, which is a major difference.

**Conclusion:** For US users, the payment and refund policies are nearly identical and very restrictive. For EU users, Speak's terms are significantly more consumer-friendly due to the inclusion of mandatory withdrawal rights.

#### 3. Dispute Resolution and Governing Law

* **Duolingo:**
  * **Governing Law:** Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, USA, for all users.
  * **Forum:** Courts in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania.
  * **Arbitration:** Requires **mandatory binding arbitration** on an individual basis for all monetary disputes. Class action lawsuits are not permitted.
  * **Opt-Out:** You can opt out of arbitration by emailing `legal@duolingo.com` within 30 days of first use.
* **Speak:**
  * **Governing Law:** State of Delaware, USA.
  * **Arbitration:** Also requires **mandatory binding arbitration** on an individual basis and waives class actions.
  * **Opt-Out:** You can opt out of arbitration by emailing `support@usespeak.com` within 30 days.
  * **Exception for France/Germany:** This is a major difference. Section 23 states that for these users, the **arbitration agreement does not apply**, and disputes will be heard in their local courts under their local laws.

**Conclusion:** Both platforms push US users towards individual arbitration. However, Speak explicitly acknowledges and respects the legal jurisdictions of France and Germany, offering a much more favorable dispute resolution process for users there.

#### 4. Limitation of Liability and Warranties

* **Duolingo:**
  * **Warranty:** Provides the service "AS IS" with no warranties of any kind (merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, accuracy, etc.).
  * **Liability Cap:** Liability is limited to the amount you paid, if any, to Duolingo in the 12 months prior to the claim. There is no minimum floor like a $100 cap.
* **Speak:**
  * **Warranty:** Also provides the service "AS IS" with a similar broad disclaimer of all warranties. It specifically notes that AI Output may contain "hallucinations" and be inaccurate.
  * **Liability Cap:** Liability is limited to the greater of the amount you paid to Speak or **$100.00**.
  * **Exception for France/Germany:** Section 23 provides completely different, less restrictive liability rules for users in these countries, as required by their consumer protection laws.

**Conclusion:** Both services heavily limit their liability in a standard way for US companies. Speak's inclusion of a $100 floor is common, but its main difference is the legally-compliant, more protective liability standards for its French and German users.
