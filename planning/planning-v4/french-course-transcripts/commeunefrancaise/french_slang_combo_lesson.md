# French "Slang" Words for All Ages

Casual vocabulary is everywhere in spoken French. You need to know that informal French to communicate! A few words of French slang (for all ages!) will really help you when you're travelling in France or speaking with French friends.

I'm not talking about `les gros mots` (= literally "big, fat, thick words") which are rude like swear words. No, today we'll dive into the kind of informal words that you can use around children. French sentences that my small son could say at home!

So you can understand a text like this:

*On s'est bien marrés avec les potes ce soir. Même si la bouffe était chelou. Je me suis cassée tôt, j'étais vachement crevée. Johanna voulait me ramener en bagnole, mais tu parles ! Elle était déjà un peu bourrée. Je suis rentrée à vélo sous la flotte, c'était relou.*

Don't worry, let's dive in.

`C'est parti !`

## 1 - Informal French: "se marrer" = to laugh

`Se marrer` (informal verb) = `rire` = to laugh

`Se marrer` is a pronominal verb, meaning it comes with "se" (= "oneself"), the reflexive pronoun.

So we say for instance:

- `Je me marre.` = I'm laughing.
- `Tu te marres.` = You're laughing.
- `On se marre.` = We're laughing.

It has nothing to do with the formal verb `entacher` (= to marr).

However, it's close to another expression with another meaning.

`En avoir marre` = to be fed up with the situation, "I'm sick and tired," "I'm done with…"

> `"Quand y'en a marre, y'a Malabar"` (= When life is too much, there's always Malabar.) is a famous catchphrase for the French bubblegum brand "Malabar." "Malabar" is an area in India, but in older French slang it came to mean "a strong man."

`En avoir marre` = to be fed up with the situation, "I'm sick and tired," "I'm done with…"

For example:
`J'en ai marre, c'est toujours moi qui perds.`
= I'm done with that, I'm always the one who's losing.
= I'm sick and tired of always losing [at this game.]

Or: `Il y en a marre.` = `"Y'en a marre."` = That's enough, that's unbearable (informal)

---

## 2 - Informal French: "les potes" = buddies

`"Les potes"` (informal) = `"les copains"` (informal) = `"les amis"` (formal and heavy) = friends

There are different words to say "friends," with subtle differences.

- `Un pote / une pote` (informal) is always a friend, a "buddy."
- `Un copain / une copine` (informal) is similar, except it can also mean a romantic partner: `mon copain / ma copine` (= boyfriend / girlfriend)
- `Un ami / une amie` is the formal word for friend, but it can be intimidating. It's hard to become `un ami` with someone, it takes time and patience. Whereas `"un pote"` can be more superficial.

---

## 3 - Informal French: "la bouffe" = food, "la flotte" = water

- `La bouffe` (informal) = `la nourriture` (correct, respectful) = food
- `La flotte` (informal) = `l'eau` (correct, respectful) = water

`La bouffe` is a very common slang word. It means "food." `"Une bouffe"` is "a meal." And `bouffer` means "to eat."

For instance:
`On s'appelle, on se fait une bouffe ?`
= Let's talk on the phone later, and grab lunch or dinner at some point, OK?

`Je vais bouffer, je reviens.`
= I'm going to eat, I'll be back.

`La flotte` technically means "fleet" – but most of the time it's everyday slang for water. And rain!

→ `Il flotte` (informal) = `il pleut` (correct) = it's raining

`La flotte` and `la bouffe` are mild slang that everyone can use, but it's not elegant. Don't use it in a restaurant with the waiter! Or it will sound dismissive.

---

## 4 - Informal French: "Vachement" = very, a lot

- `La vache` (correct French) = the cow
- `Oh la vache !` (informal) = "Holy cow!" / "Oh wow!"
- `Vachement` (informal) = "very" / "a lot"

For instance:
`C'est vachement bien !` (informal) = `C'est très bien !` = That's very good!

---

## 5 - Informal French: le verlan ("relou," "chelou")

`Le verlan` is a type of slang where usuals words have their syllables switched around, `à l'envers` (= the other side around.) For instance:

- `Lourd` (= heavy / annoying) → Lou-re → Re-lou → `Relou` (= annoying)
- `Louche` (= suspect, weird) → Lou-che → `Chelou` (= weird)
- `Fou` (= crazy) → F-ou → `Ouf` (= crazy)
- `Femme` (= woman) → Fe-mme → mme-fe → `meuf` (= woman, girlfriend)
- `À l'envers` → (à) l'en-vers → (à) ver-l'en → `verlan` !

`"Lourd"` is already an informal word for `"ennuyant / embêtant"` (= annoying.)

`Le verlan` isn't really used by most people born before the 80's, but it's used a lot by younger people, and you'll definitely hear some verlan when you travel in France.

> `"Meuf"` isn't very elegant, it can be tricky to use it in the right context. A popular expression in verlan and slang: `un truc de ouf` = "something crazy!" / "That's crazy / awesome!"

---

## 6 - Informal French: to leave ("se tirer", "se casser")

- `Tirer` (correct French) = to pull / to shoot
- `Se tirer` (informal) = to leave
- `Casser` (correct French) = to break
- `Se casser` (informal) = to leave

It's pronominal, just like "se marrer," remember?

### Four ways to say "I'm leaving" in French

- `Je me tire` (informal slang)
- `Je me casse` (informal slang)
- `Je pars` (correct French)
- `Je m'en vais` (correct French)

> `Tu te tires ailleurs.` (= You take off somewhere else.) sounds like "tirailleur" (= a military term for "skirmisher" or "infantryman")

---

## 7 - Informal French: tired and hungry

- `Je suis crevée.` (informal) = `Je suis très fatiguée.` = I'm dead tired, really tired.
- `J'ai la dalle.` (informal) = `J'ai très faim.` = `Je suis affamé.` (formal) = I'm really hungry.

`Crever` means "to burst / to puncture", but it's also used informally for "dying" (like "to croak.")

And it can then be used in other expressions!

`Je meurs de faim.` = "I'm dying of hunger, I'm famished."
→ `Je crève de faim.` (same but more informal)
→ `Je crève la dalle.` (same but even more informal)

---

## 8 - Informal French: "Tu parles !", "bagnole," "bourré."

Let's finish with a lightning round, before going back to the text from the introduction.

`Tu parles !` = "You're talking!" (literally) = "Yeah, right…" (sarcastic)

The sarcastic expression `Tu parles` is never used with "Vous" or "Ils" or other pronouns.

### French words for "car"

- `L'automobile` (formal French)
- `Le véhicule` (administrative)
- `La bagnole` (informal French)
- `La caisse` (informal French) = literally "the box"

### French words for "drunk"

- `Ivre` (correct French)
- `Soûl` (correct French)
- `En état d'ébriété` (administrative)
- `"Pompette"` (slightly drunk and happy, cutesy word)
- `Bourré` (common slang)
- `Pété, rond, torché, beurré…` (other slang words!)

### Two fun expressions for "drunk" in particular

- `Rond comme une queue de pelle` = "round like a shovel's handle"
- `Beurré comme un coing` = "buttered like a quince"

> `See also the more up-to-date slang "genre":`
>
> - `Genre !` = As if!
> - `Tu fais genre…` = You're acting as if [+ something] / You're pretending.
> - `Fais pas genre.` = Stop pretending / Stop acting as if [+ something]

---

## 9 - Informal French: Can you understand?

`On s'est bien marrés avec les potes ce soir.`
= "On a bien ri avec les amis, ce soir"
= We had a good laugh with the friends this evening.

`Même si la bouffe était chelou.`
= Même si la nourriture était étrange.
= Even though the food was weird.

`Je me suis cassée tôt, j'étais vachement crevée.`
= Je suis partie tôt, j'étais très fatiguée.
= I left early, I was really tired.

`Johanna voulait me ramener en bagnole, mais tu parles !`
= Johanna voulait me ramener en voiture, mais bon.
= Johanna wanted to drive me back in her car, but, yeah, right!

`Elle était déjà un peu bourrée.`
= Elle était déjà un peu soûle.
= She was a bit drunk (tipsy) already.

`Je suis rentrée à vélo sous la flotte, c'était relou.`
= Je suis rentrée à vélo sous la pluie, c'était embêtant.
= I got back home on my bike under the rain, that was annoying.

# Course: Shocking French Slang (And How to Soften It)

## Introduction

Some French slang can sound quite shocking when you translate it literally. These words and expressions are often colourful (though mostly brown-themed!), and while they might be inappropriate in polite company, they are frequently used in everyday situations.

So, which words are they? And what can you say instead if you’re around children or grandmothers? Let’s find out!

---

## Merde

`Merde` is perhaps the most well-known French swear word. It technically means “feces” or “shit.”

### Usage as a Swear Word (Juron)

Like its English counterpart, it’s most often used as a *juron*—a swear word you say when you’re angry, frustrated, or hurt.

`Softer Alternatives:`

- *Zut !*
- *Flûte !*
- *Mince !*
- *Purée* (literally "mashed potatoes," it has a satisfying "r" sound)

### Usage as an Adjective

`De merde` is used to qualify a noun, literally meaning “shitty.” For example, a famous website started as *Vie de Merde* (Shitty Life), which was translated into English as "F— My Life."

`Softer Alternatives:`

- *Pourri* (rotten)
- *Naze* (lousy)
- *Nul* (really bad)

> *J’ai un vélo pourri, j’ai presque hâte qu’on me le vole.*
> I have a lousy bike, I’m almost looking forward to having it stolen.

---

## Le bordel

Technically, `le bordel` is a brothel. However, it's a useful word that most often means “a real mess,” implying something is untidy and disorganized.

### Usage for "A Mess"
>
> *C’est un vrai bordel chez toi !*
> Your place is a real mess.

`Softer Alternative:`
You can use a more proper comparison with *un bazar*.
> *Ta chambre c’est le bazar.*
> Your room is really messy.

### Other Forms

- `En bordel:` This means "in a mess" or "disorderly." The proper term is *en désordre*.
    > *Mon sac est en bordel.* (My bag is a mess.)
- `Bordélique:` This is the adjective form for a messy person. The proper adjective is *désordonné*.
    > *J’arrive pas à trouver mes chaussettes, je suis vraiment bordélique.*
    > I can’t find my socks, I’m a really messy person.
- `Ton bordel:` This is a synonym for *tes trucs* (your stuff) or more properly, *tes affaires* (your things).
    > *Tu prends ton bordel et tu dégages!*
    > You take your stuff and leave now!
- `As a Swear Word (Juron):` It can also be used on its own as an exclamation of frustration, with the same alternatives as *merde*.

---

## Faire chier

`On se fait chier` is a very common expression that literally means “it’s making me shit.” It's a dramatic way of saying you are very bored (*on s’ennuie*).

### Usage for "To Annoy"

The verb *ennuyer* also means “to annoy,” and that’s another meaning of `faire chier`.

> *Tu me fais chier avec tes questions !*
> You’re annoying me with your questions! (Proper: *Tu m’ennuies avec tes questions !*)

### Usage as a Swear Word (Juron)

When something annoying happens, you can express your frustration with an eloquent:
> *Fait chier !*

`Softer Alternatives:` *Zut !*, *Mince !*, etc.

---

## Cul sec

`Cul sec !` literally means “dry ass,” but it’s the French equivalent of “bottoms up!” or drinking something "in one gulp."

### Alternative

A more proper, though less colorful, way to say this is `d'un coup`.

> *Il a bu son verre cul sec.* / *Il a bu son verre d’un coup.*
> He drank his glass in one gulp.

*(Note: This expression isn’t considered particularly offensive.)*

---

## Putain

A `putain` is a prostitute. In a strange cultural evolution, this word is both very offensive when directed at a woman, but also an incredibly common interjection used to punctuate sentences. It is used to express everything from frustration and anger to surprise and amazement.

---

## Mix & Match

If you’re really frustrated, angry, hurt, or amazed, you can also mix and match the swear words for added emphasis:

- *Putain de merde !*
- *Bordel de merde !*
- *Putain de bordel de merde (fais chier) !*

Or, you know, you can stick to the softer alternatives: *purée, zut !*

# French Slang: Words Added To The Dictionary in 2022 (Year in Review)

### Salut

French is an evolving language. Each year, new words are added to the main French dictionaries. They reflect the changes in our vocabulary, and in society at large.

Let's talk together about a few of these new French words of 2022.

### C'est parti

## 0) Introduction: Les dictionnaires

### Un dictionnaire = a dictionary

Today, we'll talk about some of the new words that will appear in next year's edition of the two main French dictionaries, both named after their founders, published by for-profit private groups, and updated every year with a new edition:

- `Le Petit Larousse` created in the 1890-1900s, a bit more conservative, tries to find logical explanations for language changes.

- `Le Petit Robert` created in the 60's, a bit more sociological view, simply surveying and observing the words that are used.

They're both trying to be seen as simple references of how French people actually use their language. To be honest, they're rarely used in 2022. But every year, they tell the press which words they're going to add to their next editions, to drum up some publicity.

You can find the whole lists here: [Le Petit Robert](link) / [Le Larousse](link)

Personally, I find it easier to simply use [le Wiktionaire](link), the Wikipedia version. Or the linguistic resources of the CNTRL (*Centre National de Ressources Textuelles et Lexicales*), affiliated to the public science institute of *CNRS* (*Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique*).

## 1) Les mobilités douces

*La mobilité douce = soft mobility*

*La circulation douce = gentle traffic, soft transportation*

"Soft mobility" is any kind of transportation that's less polluting than a car. Sometimes trains are included as "soft transportation," or trams, and sometimes it only means "bicycles and walking."

Individually, these words aren't new, but the concept behind these expressions have been trending in France for the last few years. It comes from a desire in some French cities to move away from car-centric urbanism. Mainly by closing streets as *une rue piétonne (= a street for walkers only, no cars allowed)* or by creating *une piste cyclable (= a bike lane)* for *le vélo (= bicycle),*

The most bicycle-friendly French cities are Grenoble and Strasbourg.

*La mobilité douce* is often linked to *l'écologie (= environmentalism),* and even the trending concept of *la transition écologique (= transition towards environmental sustainability.)*

Here's a (pay-walled) article mentioning "la mobilité douce". It's about offering new VAE as self-service rentals. *Un VAE (un vélo à assistance électrique) = un vélo électrique = an electric bicycle*

## 2) La gênance

*La gênance = Awkwardness.*

"Awkward / Awkwardness" doesn't have a great translation in French. We can use Gênant / La gêne, and it roughly works. But it also means "bothering, being an obstacle" so it doesn't exactly fit.

With American culture spreading more and more with the Internet, young French people wanted their own word to translate "awkward." So they made one: la gênance. It's a new word, not everyone will approve of using it, but it's catching on just enough to get in a dictionary.

J'ai échappé à un moment de gênance. =
J'ai échappe à un moment gênant. =
I avoided an awkward moment. / I got out of an awkward moment.

## 3) Le wokisme

*Le wokisme = Wokism.*

American culture wars have an impact on French culture, but the vocabulary to talk about it sometimes lags behind a bit. So we get barely Frenchified words like "le wokisme" as newspapers headlines. In France too some people claim that wokism is a very dangerous discourse, while other people claim it doesn't even exist.

Tangentially, people are also talking (in good or bad) about l'écriture inclusive (= inclusive spelling.) It's not the hot controversial thing as of right now (late 2022), but heated discussions about it come and go.

## Extra mile: Grab bag about "écriture inclusive" (as I understand it)

Gender holds a special place in the French language, even more than in English. For instance, as you know, in the French language everything is either masculine or feminine: "une table" is feminine, "un dessert" is masculine. And more importantly, the plural of a mixed group (feminine and masculine nouns together) is always masculine.

Ces hommes et ces femmes sont tous français. = These men and these women are all French. (Here "français" is in the form of the masculine plural.)
Les Français sont gentils. = French people are nice. (Here "Français" uses the masculine form, even though the underlying people are men and women.)

This can be seen as suboptimal. Recently, some militants have been advocating for a rethinking of these rules, by trying things like:

- Ces hommes et ces femmes sont toutes françaises. (The adjective takes the gender of the closest noun that comes before, here it's feminine.)
- Nous sommes Français·es. (= "We're all French," using le point médian to indicate that a noun regroups feminine and masculine elements.)
- Les Français·es sont tou·te·s gentil·les (using le point médian on adjective as well.)

Another experiment has been using gender-neutral pronouns. One of them seems to have emerged as the more solid candidate: *iel*, especially used for "*il ou elle*" (*"he or she."*)

Now, don't get me wrong, there are only two occasions where you might stumble on *un point médian* or *iel* in French: if you're following some special feminist, left-wing circles, or if you're following some specific conservative, right-wing people who like to make fun of it.

The results have issues, obviously, but at least I find the experiment interesting, and it might help clear up some things when you're browsing French Twitter.

## 4) La grossophobie

*La grossophobie = fatphobia.* From *gros* (= *big*, or *fat*.)

French people aren't immune to obesity. And obese French people often face additional hardships and hostility from society, and that's: *grossophobe.*

It's different from *la glottophobie* (= *glottophobia, discrimination based on the accent*.)

The French accent you'll hear on TV and in movies is almost always a "Parisian" accent. French regional accents are declining (even the "real" original popular Parisian accent has almost disappeared), and seen as somewhat backwards. Sometimes it's charming and down-to-earth, but it's just as often the butt of a joke. It also applies to the accents of foreigners or immigrants, but then it's part of plain xenophobia.

I would write pages about the treatment of French accents in French culture, but I feel like this song covers most of it.

- [Les paroles en français](link) (= the lyrics in French)

## 5) Le Covid long (& l'Académie française)

*Le Covid long* (= *Long Covid*)
*Covidé, covidée* (= *person who's got Covid*.)

COVID is part of our lives now.

There's been some grammar talk during the pandemic: *le Covid* or *la Covid*?

While virtually everyone was saying "le" (masculine), in May 2020 l'Académie française published a note saying that people should say "la" instead. (Probably because the one woman in charge decided it by herself.) This note created an outsized discussion in the media and population, giving ammunition to the institutions and people who enjoy correcting other people. But in the end, everyone is pretty much saying "le Covid" still.

So let's talk a little about l'Académie. It's been founded 1634 by le cardinal Richelieu, to centralize the spelling and definitions of the French language.

## Le truc en plus

Richelieu is also well-known for being the villain in the story of Les trois mousquetaires, by writer Alexandre Dumas. That story has been adapted countless times, and there's a new movie coming up, with at least an all-star casting. [Trailer for the movie](link).

But is centralization necessary? Or desirable? Even now? Is it even possible?

Les Académiciens, the members of the French Academy, are politicians, former politicians, philosophers, a clergyman, a biologist... Very few members have any kind of background in linguistics or even grammar. They're supposed to publish up-to-date dictionaries, but in 400 years of existence, they've only published... 8 of them. The last one they completed was published in 1935.

The Académie publishes notes from time to time, sometimes making a stand against a (perceived) common mistake in using the language. Their influence in shaping the language is usually limited to center-right media and a few official forms. Beyond their limited actual influence, the charge also comes with a lot of money and real estate, with practically no oversight.

But they do have some prestige in French culture! Partly because they have good aesthetics: the Académiciens get to wear a gorgeous green vest and a cool ceremonial sword, and they call themselves les Immortels (= the Immortals.)

And partly because the idea of an opaque conclave of experts guarding the "real" French language is indeed appealing to some. Unfortunately, they're not experts, they're not safeguarding it effectively, and there's not even a "real, set" language.

I used to be more sympathetic about l'Académie. But I found good arguments "against" it by several sources, mainly:

- [Le français est à nous ! - By Maria Candea & Laélia Véron](link)
- [La VÉRITÉ sur l'Académie française - By French YouTube channel Linguisticae, a linguist](link)

That long video hits many points, including:

- L'Académie is not an independent council, but historically tied to power - including shameful links with Nazi Collaboration during WWII.
- L'Académie isn't a council of experts of the language and innovative writers - but rather a club for retired politicians, nobles and high bourgeoisie with different kinds of formation. They're old, very largely male, and picked according to inside negotiations between ideological sides, instead of merit or competence.
- Their actual work is often based on shoddy reasoning and faulty grammatical history. The one time they tried to issue a grammar book, it was largely incoherent and missing a ton of cases.
- The members don't often come to the meetings and office. They delegate a large part of their work to low-paid interns with poor working conditions. The Académie's funding is opaque and expensive.
- Other countries work just as well without an Académie.

## 6) New words from other countries

Le Baiser (= literally "the romantic kiss") gets one more meaning: it's also une pâtisserie belge (= a pastry from Belgium.)
Le café blanc (= "white coffee") is not a coffee - but a drink made with hot water, honey, and orange blossom water, from le Liban (= Lebanon.)
Le planchodrome is a word from le Québec, meaning "skatepark." In France, we simply call it le skatepark.
French people often jump to creating anglicisms, because it sounds cooler. But Québec can be very protective of its French language - by law. Often, when French people use English words, there's a more direct translation coming from Québec. Here, un planchodrome is a place where you use une planche à roulette (= a skateboard.)

In France, we would say faire du skateboard / faire du skate, au skatepark.

## Le truc en plus

The most egregious example of Québec / France differences is probably in the title of English movies. Québec has to translate them to French by law, and it's sometimes clunky. While in France we would use the English title... or change it but keep it in English. And it doesn't always make sense.

For instance:

- The Hangover → Lendemain de veille (Québec) / Very Bad Trip (France)
- Step Up → Vivre pour danser (Québec) / Sexy Dance (France)
- Cool Runnings → Les Apprentis Champions (Québec) / Rasta Rockett (France)

Finally, une go (= a girlfriend) is a new word for une petite amie / une copine (familiar) / une meuf (verlan slang.) It's an African word. French language has long been influenced by African and Arab languages, and this influence has been more pronounced with immigration since the 1960s. Especially for slang and youth culture.

## 7) The extra mile - Blog only: more new words

Un ascenseur émotionnel = "an emotional lift," an emotional rollercoaster
Un pervers narcissique = "a malignant narcissist, a sociopath." The concept has been getting some traction these last few years to talk about a manipulative man, with dark triad personality traits. See also the movie: Mon Roi (2015), by Maïwenn, with French actor Vincent Cassel.

Chiller = "to chill, to relax" → se relaxer, se détendre (= to relax), glander (familiar French: to loaf around, to do nothing)

Un brouteur = in Africa, it's un arnaqueur (= a con man, a fraudster) that specifically operates on the Internet, like catfishing, false classified ads or more. The word spread here as well as they started to target people living in France. See more: [Brouteur (Internet) (Wikipedia)](link)

# 20 French Fluency Shortcuts: Slang

## Salut

French slang isn't just for young people! If you want to sound more fluent when speaking French and if you want to understand real French people better if they talk, it's essential that you learn some common slang words.

In this compilation of my most popular videos on French slang, you'll uncover 20 unique informal words to enrich your vocabulary and enhance your fluency effortlessly.

C'est parti.

## 1) French Phrases: 5 French Slang Words Anyone Can Use Without Sounding Awkward

### 1 - Chouette

Chouette = nice, cool, super, fine.
C'est chouette ! = That's cool, that's nice.
Ce livre est vraiment chouette. = That book is really cool, really good.
It just sounds so friendly and cheerful! You can also say:

C'est sympa.
C'est super.
C'est cool.
But "chouette" just sounds better.
Une chouette = an owl.
Le truc en plus: There are two words for owls in French. Le hibou is an owl with egrets on its head (feathers that look like "ears"), and la chouette is an owl without egrets.

### 2 - Fais gaffe

Fais gaffe ! = Be careful!
It is also close to Attention! In French, "Attention !" is always a warning. It's not a neutral "Attention, please."

Je fais gaffe. = I'm (being) careful.
Tu fais gaffe. = You are (being) careful.
Tu fais gaffe à pas marcher sur ce câble. = You're being careful not to walk on this cable.
Elle fait gaffe aux courants d'air. = She's careful about air drafts.
Other synonyms for "une gaffe" (= a gaffe):
Une bourde = a blunder,
Un faux pas = a faux pas,
Une erreur = a mistake.

It comes in verbs too:
Faire une gaffe = commit a gaffe (make a mistake),
Faire une erreur = make a mistake,
Se tromper = To mistake, to err, to be wrong,
Se planter = informal for "se tromper".
Depending on the context, the verb gaffer can mean "to make a mistake" or "being careful" (especially as se gaffer).

Oups, j'ai gaffé. = Oops, I made a mistake.
Là, il faut que tu te gaffes. = Now, you have to be careful.
We must mention Gaston Lagaffe by Belgian comic book author Franquin when discussing gaffes. A riff on the Beatniks and the creative yet lazy youth of the late 50s and 60s, the character remains popular and inspired a movie adaptation.

### 3 - Se marrer

Se marrer = informal verb for rire = to laugh.
Attention: it has nothing to do with "la marée", which means "a tide".
J'me marre. = Je me marre. = I'm laughing.
Marrant = funny

C'est marrant. = That's funny.
C'est trop marrant. = That's so funny.
Ah, c'est marrant, j'savais pas. = Ah, c'est marrant, je ne savais pas. = Oh, it's funny, I didn't know that.
Le truc en plus: "Se marrer" used to mean "to be bored", but by irony, the meaning switched to "funny" in the XIXth century.

### 4 - Vachement

Vachement = literally "like a cow". It's an informal adverb for "very", and it's not rude at all, but it's not elegant either. In everyday French, we also use trop (= too much) as a synonym for très (= very.)

C'est vachement marrant. = That's really funny.
Juliette est une nana vachement chouette. = Juliette is a really cool girl.
C'est drôle. = That's funny. (less informal)
Julien est pas un gas vachement marrant. = Julien isn't a terribly funny guy.
C'est vachement bien! (informal) = C'est très bien! C'est super bien! = That's very good!
Il y a vachement de monde. (informal) = Il y a beaucoup de monde. = There are a lot of people.
In modern colloquial spoken French, we often use Trop (= too much) as a synonym of Très (= very).
C'est trop bien! = That's too good. That's so good. That's very good.
Of course, sometimes, you'll need to use the context to decide if trop means "very" or "too much".
Oh, tu es trop gentille! (Merci beaucoup!) = Oh, you're so/very nice! Thank you!
Oh, tu es trop gentille! (Arrête de te laisser faire!) = Oh, you're too much of a nice person! Stop being such a pushover!

### 5 - La nana

Une nana = une fille = a girl (informal word in French)
Le truc en plus: And it has nothing to do with the nickname 'nana' for grandmothers! Here in France, une grand-mère (= a grandmother) can have different nicknames, but the most common ones are mémé or mamie (= granny.)

Une nana is also called "une meuf" in le verlan slang.

Un mec, un type, un gars = un homme, un garçon = a guy, a man, a boy
Un mec bien = a good guy.
T'as vu ce type? = Tu as vu ce type? = Did you see that guy?
Salut les gars! = Hi, guys! (the "r" in "gars" is silent)
Ce mec fait vachement gaffe. = That guy is really careful.
Amélie est super chouette, on se marre beaucoup. = Amélie is so cool, we have a lot of fun.

## 2) French Slang: Up-To-Date Colloquial French Expressions (Learn French)

### 6 - C'est chaud

In correct, standard French, chaud means "warm, hot."
Attention, c'est chaud! = Be careful. It's hot!
J'ai chaud. = It's hot in here. I'm feeling too hot.
And yeah, we say "J'ai chaud" and not "Je suis chaude" because, in colloquial French, Je suis chaud (masculine) means "I'm motivated." While "Je suis chaude." (feminine) means "I'm aroused."

But "C'est chaud" is something else when applied to something or a situation. In colloquial French, it means: "It's hard, it's difficult."
C'est chaud d'apprendre tous les verbes en français. = It's hard to learn all the French verbs.
J'ai un train dans dix minutes, ça va être chaud. = I have a train in ten minutes, it's going to be difficult to catch it.
Le test était chaud, mais je pense que ça va aller. = The test was hard, but I think it will be fine.
"C'est chaud" can also mean "hardcore/borderline" too.

T'as vu ce qu'il a fait? C'est chaud! = Did you see what he just did? That's hardcore!
C'est chaud de dire ça, devant tout le monde. = That's hardcore/borderline acceptable to say that in front of everybody.
Bon, Lionel, j'ai pas de problème avec ta vaisselle sale, mais là c'est chaud quand même. = Well, Lionel, usually I don't have a problem with dirty dishes, but now, that's becoming too much, I have to say.

### 7 - Kiffer

"Kiffer" is a very popular slang word in conversational French, especially for Millennials and younger. It comes from an Arab word, le kif, meaning "pleasure, good time."

Kiffer = aimer (to love), apprécier (to enjoy)
Je kiffe ce groupe. = I like this band.
On est là pour kiffer! = We're here to have a good time!
Je te kiffe. = I like you. or I love you. (but with less formality/elegance)
C'est le (gros) kif! = That's a (really) enjoyable moment!
On kiffe! = We're enjoying the moment!
un kiffeur = un bon vivant, an Epicurean who enjoys life.

### 8 - Relou

Relou = annoying = verlan slang for "lourd" (= very; with a silent "d").
Le verlan is a special way to create slang words in French by saying them backwards = à l'envers (= in reverse.) Verlan is itself verlan for à l'envers.

Relou always means "annoying."
Tu peux arrêter? T'es relou. = Can you stop? You're annoying. (informal pronunciation: "Tu es" becomes "T'es")
Mardi c'est relou, on peut se voir demain plutôt? = Tuesday is inconvenient. Can we meet tomorrow instead?
Je me suis fait accoster par un relou. = a creep has propositioned me.
Lourd mostly means "heavy":
Ton sac est très lourd! = Your bag is really heavy!
Il fait lourd... = The weather is heavy. (there's pressure, like before a storm)
It can also mean "annoying":
Oh, t'es lourd. = Oh, you're annoying.
Arrête avec tes blagues lourdes. = Stop with the unsubtle, crass jokes.
Arrête avec ta drague lourde. = Stop with the heavy-handed flirting.
In colloquial (but a bit old-fashioned) French, we also use lourdingue = annoying, frustrating, tiring, unsubtle, shitty.

### 9 - Poser un lapin

Poser un lapin = to stand someone up (literally "to put a rabbit on there")
Il m'a posée un lapin! = He stood me up!
The origin of the expression: "Poser un lapin" nowadays means not showing up for a meeting or date without notifying them. In 1880, it originally meant "to not repay a young girl's favors." Back then, "lapin" referred to refusal of payment. Later, it also meant a stowaway. The current form of the expression likely originated around 1890 from "laisser poser," meaning "to keep someone waiting."
Le truc en plus: "Savez-vous planter les choux?" = Do you know how to plant cabbages? is a very popular French nursery rhyme.

### 10 - Planter

Planter = to stand someone up (colloquial).
Planter = to plant (literally)
Planter un légume = to plant a vegetable.
Il m'a plantée au dernier moment. = He bailed at the last moment. He left me high and dry.
Planter can have a wide variety of meanings in everyday French, though.
Se planter = to make a mistake.

- Je me suis planté d'arrêt! = Oh no, I left at the wrong stop!

Rester planté = staying put.

- Aide-moi, ne reste pas planté là! = Help me, don't simply stand and watch!

Planter quelqu'un (avec un couteau) = stabbing someone

- Il était en colère et il l'a planté! = He was angry and stabbed him!

We'd rather say:

Il l'a planté avec un couteau. = He stabbed him with a knife.

Il lui a planté un couteau dans le ventre. = He stabbed a knife in his belly.

### 11 - Se faire des films

Faire un film, faire des films = to make a movie, to make movies (literally)

- Perrine fait des films. = Perrine makes movies.

Se faire des films = to fantasize, to imagine (literally "to movies for yourself")

- Perrine se fait des films. = Perrine is imagining things.
- Il ne va pas t'appeler, arrête de te faire des films. = He's not going to call you. Stop imagining things. Stop making movies in your head.
- Oh, personne ne lui en veut, elle se fait des films, c'est tout. = Oh, nobody's holding a grudge against her. She's just being delusional, that's all.

Rêver = to dream
Imaginer = to imagine
Imaginaire = Imaginary
Fantasmer = to fantasize, especially of un fantasme.
Un fantasme = a fantasy, especially a sexual fantasy.
La fantaisie = whimsy
La fantasy = fantasy as a literary genre, like Lord of the Rings.
Le merveilleux = wonderful, fantastic + literary genre of fairy tales
Fantastique = fantastic, unbelievable
Fantasque = erratic, air-headed
Un fantôme = a ghost

### 12 - (Se) prendre la tête

Se prendre la tête = literally to take your head; in colloquial French, it means "to stress out, to overthink."

- Ça fait une heure que je me prends la tête sur ce problème. = I have been stressing out about this problem for an hour.
- Détends-toi, tu te prends trop la tête. = Relax, you're over-worrying.

Prendre la tête = To take the lead, to become the leader (correct French)

- Il a pris la tête de la course. = He took the lead in the race./He's in first place.
- Elle a pris la tête de l'entreprise. = She took over the business. She's now head of the company.

Prendre la tête = To be annoying, To give a hard time (correct French)

- Arrête, tu me prends la tête! = Stop it, you're bothering me!, like "you're confronting me, and I don't like it."
- Il lui a pris la tête toute la soirée. = He's been bugging her the whole evening. / He's been giving her a hard time.
- Ce problème me prend la tête. = This problem is annoying. / It's giving me a hard time. / It's killing me. (figuratively)

We also say: Casser les pieds = "to break the feet" = to be annoying.
Tu me casses les pieds! = You're bothering me!
C'est très casse-pied. = That's very annoying.
There are rules to this colloquial expression:
It's not "Tu prends sa tête," / "Je prends ma tête".
It's really "Tu (lui) prends la tête," (= You're annoying them) / "Je me prends la tête" (= I'm stressing out.).

It's rarely about Saint Denis, the first bishop of Paris who's holding his own head in his representations - what experts call un saint céphalophore, "saint who's holding his own head".

Le truc en plus:

And at the intersection of Casser les pieds and Prendre la tête, we have un casse-tête (= "a head breaker" literally), which is a riddle, an enigma, or a physical "brain teaser" puzzle. Like these interlocking metal links that you have to break apart - what we call un casse-tête chinois (= a Chinese puzzle).

That's also the name of a great 2013 movie with Romain Duris and Audrey Tautou, a sequel to "L'Auberge Espagnole."

## 3) English Words That Will Never Translate Into French

### 13 - A snack

- Le goûter = a light bite in the afternoon (especially for children). For example, une viennoiserie: un croissant or un pain au chocolat.

- Un en-cas = short for "en cas de besoin" (literally "in case you need it"). It is the closest thing to "a snack," but the word is formal and rarely used.
- Grignoter = to nibble and to eat outside of meals. Usually used negatively:

Je devrais arrêter de grignoter entre les repas. = I should stop having snacks between meals.

- Un casse-croûte = "a break-crust", is a simple meal, often a sandwich. You can eat things for a lunch break on the road when walking around a city or hiking in nature.

French culture doesn't allow "snacks," light food outside meals. We still do it anyway, but it's a cultural blind spot. Instead of a precise translation of the noun "a snack," we use verbs like "grignoter" or... the English word directly: "un snack."

### 14 - Rude

"Rude" is a false friend, a false cognate! The French adjective "rude" exists, but we don't use it for everyday impoliteness or offensively bad manners.

The English adjective "Rude" is in French:

- Impoli = impolite
- Grossier / Vulgaire = Vulgar
- Insultant = Insulting
- Agressif = Aggressive

These words care more about a breach of etiquette rather than hurt feelings. That's a nice summary of the stereotypical cultural differences between French and American people!

In French, on the other hand:
Rude = harsh (weather), difficult (task), brutal (treatment), rough
Or using the dictionary definitions, we find other synonyms:

- Rugueux = rough (une peau rude = rough skin)
- Sévère = strict, harsh (Tu as été rude avec lui. = You were harsh with him.)
- Frustes = rough-mannered (des manières rudes = rough manners)
- Redoutable = formidable. (une rude concurrence = formidable opposition)

Le truc en plus: We sometimes use the adverb "rudement" to mean "very, particularly." It's a bit old-fashioned now. But you might still find French books where someone says:
C'est rudement bien! = It's really good! / It's so good!

### 15 - Judgmental

French culture can be very judgmental! But there's no simple translation for the word itself. Instead, we have:

- Méprisant = scornful,
- Accusateur = accusing,
- Moralisateur = sanctimonious, moralizing,
- Critique = critical.

Elle m'a jeté un regard critique. = She gave me a critical look.
And verbs:
Juger = to judge
Critiquer / Faire des critiques = to criticize / to give criticism
It's like the expression "Holier than thou": there's no clear French translation, but it's a common dynamic nonetheless!
Le truc en plus: "Critique" is also used for art or food appreciation!
Un critique = a critique
Une critique = a review

### 16 - Offended

The French language does have a translation for this:
Offensé(e) = offended.
However, it sounds outdated - more appropriate for an XVIIIth century offense to one's honor requiring a duel or something. Related words are only used for sports and the military:

L'offense = the offense (an attack)
Offensif = offensive (focused on attacking).
For offended feelings, instead, we'd use adjectives such as:

- Choqué(e) = shocked. (Or "sous le choc" = under the shock.)
- Blessé(e) = hurt, wounded. And not béni (= blessed.)
- Heurté(e) = bumped

Heurter = to hit without meaning to, to bump into (literally)
La voiture a heurté une barrière. = The car hit a safety barrier / bumped into a barrier.
J'ai été heurté par tes paroles. = Your words have struck me. Your words have hurt me. (metaphorically)

- Vexé = piqued, vexed.

Vexer = to pique someone's pride, to hit someone's self-assurance.

- Tu ne m'as pas invitée, ça m'a vexé, je suis vexée. = You didn't invite me. It hurt my pride.

So "offended" is a bit of a mix of "heurté" and "vexé": a hit that can hurt, but also an attack on your pride.
Now, in real life, meanings can change. And with the influence of American culture on French discourse, offensé is making a comeback: young French people use more and more simply offensé as a direct translation for "offended." But it didn't fully catch on yet.

Le truc en plus: The same thing is happening with the English adjective "offensive" as well. You can use:
Blessant = hurtful,
Injurieux = injurious, verbally abusive,
Insultant = insulting.

But when translating English views of something being "offensive," French people simply use offensant more and more. Even though the word didn't exist before.

### 17 - Confusing

Confusing = déroutant, confus.
However, there's a bit more behind this:

- Déroutant (= literally "rerouting") also has a meaning of "surprising, original, unusual." And it hints at a hidden order behind the confusion something you haven't yet understood.
Un film déroutant = An unusual movie you didn't fully understand (but you could, with time and thought.)
- Confus also means "confused" and "messy."

Un film confus = a movie that doesn't quite know what points to make, a messy movie.
French people started using confusant as well. It's a clumsy direct translation that sounds weird. Like offensant earlier, it's not widespread, but it's becoming more common.

However, the official arbiter of the French language, l'Académie française, has issued an official reclamation against using "confusant"! Instead, they recommend using:

- Troublant = troubling,
- Perturbant = disturbing.

But once again, the meanings don't precisely match.

### 18 - Empowerment

The English term "Empowerment" comes from the feminist struggles of the early-XXth century. But for the French public, this concept was mainly introduced in the 2000s by prominent organizations such as l'ONU (l'Organisation des Nations-Unies) (= the UN) or la Banque Mondiale (= the World Bank.) Now, we use it for business and management, far from its radical roots. And since business and management love using English words, they didn't look very far for a suitable French translation.

The official translation is l'autonomisation, but it sounds robotic, while la responsabilisation sounds judgmental, or l'émancipation, which sounds tied to the fight against slavery / for voting rights. L'empouvoirement also exists, but it sounds ugly and is rarely used.

So in most cases, people use the English word directly: "Empowerment."
Coming from Québec, we have an alternative: le pouvoir d'agir (= the power to act, to do things). And it comes back to the activist roots of empowerment.

Le truc en plus: Le pouvoir d'agir also offers a nice translation for "agency" (in sociology/psychology), the capacity to act. The official translation is agentivité, but it's pretty obscure. For a "travel agency" or an "Intelligence Agency", we simply say une agence.

### 19 - Awkward

Awkward = Gênant, or Gêné
J'ai eu un moment gênant avec Julien. = I had an awkward moment with Julien.
Hum, désolé je suis un peu gêné. = Hmm, sorry, I'm being a bit awkward.
However, we also have:

- Gênant = embêtant = troublesome / annoying

Mon vélo a crevé, donc c'est gênant pour se déplacer. = My bike tire punctured, so it's difficult to move around.

- Gêné = embêté = having trouble / being annoyed

Je suis gêné pour venir te voir. = I'll have some trouble coming to see you.
Between "awkward" and "troublesome," there are

- Mal à l'aise = ill at ease,
- Embarrassant(e) = embarrassing
- Lionel se retrouve souvent dans des situations embarrassantes. = Lionel often ends up in embarrassing, awkward situations.
- Embarrassé(e) = embarrassed.
- Maladroit(e) = clumsy,

Un maladroit / une maladroite = a clumsy person.
Antoine a encore fait une remarque maladroite. = Once again, Antoine made a clumsy, awkward comment.

### 20 - Foodie

French people love eating well, but there's no word for "foodie". You can use different words to discuss your food preferences:

- Un amateur / une amatrice de bonne cuisine = someone who enjoys good food.

- Un passionné / une passionnée de restaurant = somebody who's passionate about restaurants.
- Un gastronome = who enjoys the finest food.
- Un gourmet = who really enjoys the finest food and finest wine.

Mon frère est un gourmet, il nous a invités à dîner dans un restaurant gastronomique. = My brother is a gourmet, a foodie. He invited us for dinner at a gourmet restaurant / a foodie restaurant / a fancy restaurant.

- Un gourmand = who really enjoys eating, not necessarily gourmet food.

Je suis un grand gourmand! = I really love to eat. I'm a big foodie.
There's no French "foodie." Yes, there are countless great restaurants in France. And many people really enjoy fine dining. But it didn't really become a widespread hobby or a one-word concept!

Le truc en plus: One of the obscure French songs I like is Blues gourmand (Charlélie Couture, 1997).

# French Slang: Words Added To The Dictionary in 2022 (Year in Review)

### Salut

French is an evolving language. Each year, new words are added to the main French dictionaries. They reflect the changes in our vocabulary, and in society at large.

Let's talk together about a few of these new French words of 2022.

### C'est parti

## 0) Introduction: Les dictionnaires

### Un dictionnaire = a dictionary

Today, we'll talk about some of the new words that will appear in next year's edition of the two main French dictionaries, both named after their founders, published by for-profit private groups, and updated every year with a new edition:

- **Le Petit Larousse** created in the 1890-1900s, a bit more conservative, tries to find logical explanations for language changes.

- **Le Petit Robert** created in the 60's, a bit more sociological view, simply surveying and observing the words that are used.

They're both trying to be seen as simple references of how French people actually use their language. To be honest, they're rarely used in 2022. But every year, they tell the press which words they're going to add to their next editions, to drum up some publicity.

You can find the whole lists here: [Le Petit Robert](link) / [Le Larousse](link)

Personally, I find it easier to simply use [le Wiktionaire](link), the Wikipedia version. Or the linguistic resources of the CNTRL (*Centre National de Ressources Textuelles et Lexicales*), affiliated to the public science institute of *CNRS* (*Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique*).

[Comment les mots entrent-ils dans le Petit Robert?](link)

## 1) Les mobilités douces

*La mobilité douce = soft mobility*

*La circulation douce = gentle traffic, soft transportation*

"Soft mobility" is any kind of transportation that's less polluting than a car. Sometimes trains are included as "soft transportation," or trams, and sometimes it only means "bicycles and walking."

Individually, these words aren't new, but the concept behind these expressions have been trending in France for the last few years. It comes from a desire in some French cities to move away from car-centric urbanism. Mainly by closing streets as *une rue piétonne (= a street for walkers only, no cars allowed)* or by creating *une piste cyclable (= a bike lane)* for *le vélo (= bicycle),*

The most bicycle-friendly French cities are Grenoble and Strasbourg.

*La mobilité douce* is often linked to *l'écologie (= environmentalism),* and even the trending concept of *la transition écologique (= transition towards environmental sustainability.)*

Here's a (pay-walled) article mentioning "la mobilité douce". It's about offering new VAE as self-service rentals. *Un VAE (un vélo à assistance électrique) = un vélo électrique = an electric bicycle*

## 2) La gênance

*La gênance = Awkwardness.*

"Awkward / Awkwardness" doesn't have a great translation in French. We can use Gênant / La gêne, and it roughly works. But it also means "bothering, being an obstacle" so it doesn't exactly fit.

With American culture spreading more and more with the Internet, young French people wanted their own word to translate "awkward." So they made one: la gênance. It's a new word, not everyone will approve of using it, but it's catching on just enough to get in a dictionary.

J'ai échappé à un moment de gênance. =
J'ai échappé à un moment gênant. =
I avoided an awkward moment. / I got out of an awkward moment.

## 3) Le wokisme

*Le wokisme = Wokism.*

American culture wars have an impact on French culture, but the vocabulary to talk about it sometimes lags behind a bit. So we get barely Frenchified words like "le wokisme" as newspapers headlines. In France too some people claim that wokism is a very dangerous discourse, while other people claim it doesn't even exist.

Tangentially, people are also talking (in good or bad) about l'écriture inclusive (= inclusive spelling.) It's not the hot controversial thing as of right now (late 2022), but heated discussions about it come and go.

## Extra mile: Grab bag about "écriture inclusive" (as I understand it)

Gender holds a special place in the French language, even more than in English. For instance, as you know, in the French language everything is either masculine or feminine: "une table" is feminine, "un dessert" is masculine. And more importantly, the plural of a mixed group (feminine and masculine nouns together) is always masculine.

Ces hommes et ces femmes sont tous français. = These men and these women are all French. (Here "français" is in the form of the masculine plural.)
Les Français sont gentils. = French people are nice. (Here "Français" uses the masculine form, even though the underlying people are men and women.)

This can be seen as suboptimal. Recently, some militants have been advocating for a rethinking of these rules, by trying things like:

- Ces hommes et ces femmes sont toutes françaises. (The adjective takes the gender of the closest noun that comes before, here it's feminine.)
- Nous sommes Français·es. (= "We're all French," using le point médian to indicate that a noun regroups feminine and masculine elements.)
- Les Français·es sont tou·te·s gentil·les (using le point médian on adjective as well.)

Another experiment has been using gender-neutral pronouns. One of them seems to have emerged as the more solid candidate: *iel*, especially used for "*il ou elle*" (*"he or she."*)

Now, don't get me wrong, there are only two occasions where you might stumble on *un point médian* or *iel* in French: if you're following some special feminist, left-wing circles, or if you're following some specific conservative, right-wing people who like to make fun of it.

The results have issues, obviously, but at least I find the experiment interesting, and it might help clear up some things when you're browsing French Twitter.

## 4) La grossophobie

*La grossophobie = fatphobia.* From *gros* (= *big*, or *fat*.)

French people aren't immune to obesity. And obese French people often face additional hardships and hostility from society, and that's: *grossophobe.*

It's different from *la glottophobie* (= *glottophobia, discrimination based on the accent*.)

The French accent you'll hear on TV and in movies is almost always a "Parisian" accent. French regional accents are declining (even the "real" original popular Parisian accent has almost disappeared), and seen as somewhat backwards. Sometimes it's charming and down-to-earth, but it's just as often the butt of a joke. It also applies to the accents of foreigners or immigrants, but then it's part of plain xenophobia.

I would write pages about the treatment of French accents in French culture, but I feel like this song covers most of it.

## 5) Le Covid long (& l'Académie française)

*Le Covid long* (= *Long Covid*)
*Covidé, covidée* (= *person who's got Covid*.)

COVID is part of our lives now.

There's been some grammar talk during the pandemic: *le Covid* or *la Covid*?

While virtually everyone was saying "le" (masculine), in May 2020 l'Académie française published a note saying that people should say "la" instead. (Probably because the one woman in charge decided it by herself.) This note created an outsized discussion in the media and population, giving ammunition to the institutions and people who enjoy correcting other people. But in the end, everyone is pretty much saying "le Covid" still.

So let's talk a little about l'Académie. It's been founded 1634 by le cardinal Richelieu, to centralize the spelling and definitions of the French language.

## Le truc en plus

Richelieu is also well-known for being the villain in the story of Les trois mousquetaires, by writer Alexandre Dumas. That story has been adapted countless times, and there's a new movie coming up, with at least an all-star casting. [Trailer for the movie](link).

But is centralization necessary? Or desirable? Even now? Is it even possible?

Les Académiciens, the members of the French Academy, are politicians, former politicians, philosophers, a clergyman, a biologist... Very few members have any kind of background in linguistics or even grammar. They're supposed to publish up-to-date dictionaries, but in 400 years of existence, they've only published... 8 of them. The last one they completed was published in 1935.

The Académie publishes notes from time to time, sometimes making a stand against a (perceived) common mistake in using the language. Their influence in shaping the language is usually limited to center-right media and a few official forms. Beyond their limited actual influence, the charge also comes with a lot of money and real estate, with practically no oversight.

But they do have some prestige in French culture! Partly because they have good aesthetics: the Académiciens get to wear a gorgeous green vest and a cool ceremonial sword, and they call themselves les Immortels (= the Immortals.)

And partly because the idea of an opaque conclave of experts guarding the "real" French language is indeed appealing to some. Unfortunately, they're not experts, they're not safeguarding it effectively, and there's not even a "real, set" language.

I used to be more sympathetic about l'Académie. But I found good arguments "against" it by several sources, mainly:

- [Le français est à nous ! - By Maria Candea & Laélia Véron](link)
- [La VÉRITÉ sur l'Académie française - By French YouTube channel Linguisticae, a linguist](link)

That long video hits many points, including:

- L'Académie is not an independent council, but historically tied to power - including shameful links with Nazi Collaboration during WWII.
- L'Académie isn't a council of experts of the language and innovative writers - but rather a club for retired politicians, nobles and high bourgeoisie with different kinds of formation. They're old, very largely male, and picked according to inside negotiations between ideological sides, instead of merit or competence.
- Their actual work is often based on shoddy reasoning and faulty grammatical history. The one time they tried to issue a grammar book, it was largely incoherent and missing a ton of cases.
- The members don't often come to the meetings and office. They delegate a large part of their work to low-paid interns with poor working conditions. The Académie's funding is opaque and expensive.
- Other countries work just as well without an Académie.

## 6) New words from other countries

Le Baiser (= literally "the romantic kiss") gets one more meaning: it's also une pâtisserie belge (= a pastry from Belgium.)
Le café blanc (= "white coffee") is not a coffee - but a drink made with hot water, honey, and orange blossom water, from le Liban (= Lebanon.)
Le planchodrome is a word from le Québec, meaning "skatepark." In France, we simply call it le skatepark.
French people often jump to creating anglicisms, because it sounds cooler. But Québec can be very protective of its French language - by law. Often, when French people use English words, there's a more direct translation coming from Québec. Here, un planchodrome is a place where you use une planche à roulette (= a skateboard.)

In France, we would say faire du skateboard / faire du skate, au skatepark.

## Le truc en plus

The most egregious example of Québec / France differences is probably in the title of English movies. Québec has to translate them to French by law, and it's sometimes clunky. While in France we would use the English title... or change it but keep it in English. And it doesn't always make sense.

For instance:

- The Hangover → Lendemain de veille (Québec) / Very Bad Trip (France)
