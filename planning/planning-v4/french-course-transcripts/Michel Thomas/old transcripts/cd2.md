Do you know how to spell?
Do you remember how to spell sort?
S-O-R-T.
S-O-R-T.
Do you know how to spell?
Do you remember how to spell sort?
S-O-R-T.
Do you know how to spell sort?
Do you remember how to spell sort?
S-O-R-T.
Do you know how to spell sort?
S-O-R-T.
S-O-R-T-E.
S-O-R-T-E.
S-O-R-T-E.
Yes.
Because in French, the consonant at the end of a word in French is not sounded.
Whenever you have a consonant at the end of a word, you don't sound it.
Like, you can't sound it.
Do you know how to spell sort?
Do you know how to spell sort?
Do you know how to spell sort?
Do you remember how to spell sort?
S-O-R-T-E.
S-O-R-T-E.
S-O-R-T-E.
S-O-R-T-E.
Yes.
Because in French, the consonant at the end of a word in French is not sounded.
Whenever you have a consonant at the end of a word, you don't sound it.
S-O-R-T-E.
Like, important would be important.
S-O-R-T-E.
S-O-R-T-E.
Important.
Important.
You don't sound it.
Yes.
Restaurant would be…
Restaurant.
S-O-R-T-E.
Restaurant.
Restaurant.
Restaurant.
Yes.
You don't sound it.
So again, the consonant at the end of a word in French is not sounded unless it is followed
by an E.
an E.
The E is silent but it's an indication of how to sound the preceding consonant.
So for instance, how would you pronounce P-E-T-I-T?
Petit.
Yes, possible?
Petit.
Again, I repeat.
The consonant at the end of a word is not sounded unless it is followed by an E. I spell again
P-E-T-I-T.
Oh, petit.
Petit.
Petit.
Yes.
And always go to the ending.
Petit.
Petit.
Petit.
Yes.
Petit means small.
Yes.
If you want to say it is very small would be…
C'est petit.
It is very small.
C'est très petit.
C'est très petit.
C'est très petit.
Yes.
Yes.
And if you want to make it…
If you want to say it is too small, too or too much is trot.
Très is very and trot, spelled T-R-O-P, means too or too much.
So by itself, trot means too much.
But that's also useful for too much small or too small.
Yes.
Right.
Like the word for late in French is tar.
Tar, spelled T-A-R-D, like in tar-D.
But you don't sound a D because it is spelled T-A-R-D without an E.
It's tar.
So it is very late would be…
C'est très tard.
C'est très tard.
Yes.
It is too late…
C'est trop tard.
C'est trop tard.
C'est trop tard.
Yes.
Mm-hmm.
So…
And trot by itself means too much.
If you want to say it is too much for me.
Trot.
It is too much.
C'est trop.
For me.
For moi.
Right.
C'est trop pour moi.
Yes.
Mm-hmm.
So again, P-E-T-I-T is pronounced…
Petit.
Petit.
P-E-T-I-T-E would be pronounced…
Petite.
Petite.
Right.
Mm-hmm.
G-R-A-N-D would be pronounced…
Grand.
Grand.
Grand.
Right.
G-R-A-N-D-E pronounced…
Grand.
Grand.
Grand.
Yes.
Yes.
So grand would be big or tall for masculine, for he.
Yes.
He is big, elegant.
But she is big or tall, elegant.
So grand would be big or tall for masculine, for he.
Yes.
He is big, elegant.
But she is big or tall, elegant.
So you add an E for feminine and you pronounce the consonant.
So, she is little, small would be L-A…
Petit.
Petit.
Yes.
How would you pronounce V-I-T?
V.
V.
V.
V.
V.

How would you pronounce V-I-T?

Vite.
Vite.
Vite.
V-I-T-E.
Vite means fast.
It's with vitality.
Vite.
Vite.
Vite.
Fast.
So, it is very fast would be...
C'est très...
Fast.
Vite.
First word?
Vite.
C'est très vite.
It is too fast for me.
C'est très...
Too fast.
C'est...
Trop.
Trop.
T-R-O-P.
Trop.
Trop.
So, this too fast for me would be...
C'est trop vite.
Vite.
What's more?
C'est trop vite.
Right.
Pour moi.
C'est trop vite pour moi.
Yes.
To speak is...
To speak French?
Parler.
Parler.
Parler.
Parler.
Parler, France.
To speak, parler, spelled P-E-R-L-E-R.
So the to form of the verb is expressed in the ending -er.
Parler.
Yes.
You speak would be, vous parlez,
but it has the ending -ez or -ez.
Vous parlez.
Yes.
So, you speak too fast for me would be...
Vous parlez.
Vous parlez.
Vous parlez.
Vous parlez.
Too fast.
Trop vite pour moi.
For me.
Yes.
Vous parlez trop vite pour moi.
Mm-hmm.
What is to go?
To go through the alley.
Aller.
Aller.
Aller.
Aller is spelled A-double-L-E-R.
How would you say you go or you are going?
Um...
Vous aller.
Vous aller.
Vous aller.
Vous is spelled...
V-O-U-S.
Right.
V-O-U-S.
The S, the silent S, can be pushed into the following word...
It starts with a vowel.
It starts with a vowel.
It starts with a vowel.
It starts with a vowel.
It takes on the sound of a Z or Z.
So, you are going would be...
Vous allez.
Vous allez.
Vous allez.
Vous allez.
Yes.
Again, in slow motion, it's not vous, but vous, and then Z allez.
Z allez.
Z allez.
Vous allez.
Z allez.
Z allez.
It's you go or you are going.
So, again, to go is...
Allez.
Allez.
Allez.
Allez.
Allez.
Mm-hmm.
Yes.
And you go or you are going...
Vous allez.
Vous allez.
You're going too fast for me would be...
Vous allez...
Trot...

Right.
Vite...
For me.
Pour moi.
Right.
Vous allez trop vite pour moi.
Vous allez trop vite pour moi.
Right.
Mm-hmm.
How would you say, um...
It is very good.
C'est très bon.
C'est très bon.
Mm-hmm.
If you want to say it is so good, so is si.
How would you say it is so good?
C'est si bon.
Right.
C'est si bon.
Yes.
Do you remember the song?
C'est si bon.
Yes.
C'est si bon.
It is so good.
So si, spelled S-I, means so.
Si also means if.
Right.
How would you say, if it is so good would be...
If...
Si.
Si.
Si.
It is so good.
C'est si bon.
Right.
Si, c'est si bon.

So here you have si twice.
Yes.
How would you say, I would like to know if it is so good.
I would like...
Je voudrais...
Je voudrais to know...
To have sa...
Oh, um...
Sa...
Sa...
Sa...
Right? *Safvoi* Right? *Safvoi* If it is so good. *Si*Si *Si bon. *Safvoi* Right?*Si * Si bon. *Safvoi* Yes? Yes.
The word for why is pourquoi.
Pourquoi.
Pourquoi.
Pour means for, pourquoi for what or what for or why.
Pourquoi, yes?
Why.
So, I would like to know why it is so good.
Je voudrais savoir, why it is so good.
C'est si bon.
Right.
Je voudrais savoir pourquoi c'est si bon.
So again, to go is?
Aller.
Aller.
And you are going is?
Vous allez.
Right.
I would like to know where you're going.
Je voudrais--
To know.
Savoir.

How would you pronounce P-O-R-T?
P-O-R-T.
Por.
Yes, say it again.
Por.
Por, right.
So again, the consonant at the end of a word is not sounded unless it is followed by an E.
So por, P-O-R-T, por.
Por means the port, the harbor.
Aeroport means the airport.
Aeroport.
Can you say that again?
Aeroport.
Aeroport.
Right, aeroport.
Aeroport.
Yes.
How would you pronounce P-O-R-T-E?

La porte means the door, the portal, the door, la porte.
La porte.
So again, I repeat, the consonant at the end of a word is not sounded unless it is followed by an E.
Except for four consonants.
There are four consonants that may be pronounced at the end of a word without an E.
It's easy to remember those four consonants.
could be contained in the English word careful.
I call them the careful consonants.
What are the careful consonants.

Right.
C, R, F, and L.

Now, if you pull off the A of avoir, you get...
Voir.
Voir.
Voir.
And voir means to...
To see.
Of course. To see.
So we have...
Savoir. To know.
Voir.
Voir.
Voir. To have.
Voir. To see.
Savoir. Avoir. And voir. To know what you have to see.
Yes?
Oh.
Oh.
Okay. Again.
To know.
Savoir.
To have.
Avoir.
And to see.
Voir.
Right.
Yes.
How would you say, "I would like to have something else."
Um...
Je voudrais avoir...
Something else.
Oh.
Autre chose.
Right.
Je voudrais avoir autre chose.
Je voudrais is spelled...
V-O-U-D-R-A-I-S.
V-O-U-D-R-A-I-S.
Oh.
Autre chose.
Right.
Je voudrais avoir autre chose.
Je voudrais is spelled...
Voudrais is spelled V-O-U-D-R-A-I-S.
So we have an S here at the end.
A silent S.
Which is followed by a vowel of have.
So, je voudrais avoir...
Which is fine.
Yes?
If you cut.
Je voudrais avoir autre chose.
But you can also say, "Je voudrais avoir autre chose."
Yes.
You may push the S into the vowel of avoir.
Je voudrais avoir autre chose.
Yes.
But we have to make a distinction, a sound distinction here between I would like to know.
Which is...
Je voudrais savoir.
Je voudrais savoir.
And I would like to have...
Je voudrais savoir.
Je voudrais savoir.
Je voudrais savoir.
Je voudrais savoir.
Je voudrais savoir.
Je voudrais savoir.
Right.
Je voudrais savoir.
So, whenever you push the S into the vowel, it takes under sound of a Z or a Z.
Yes?
Yes.
Je voudrais savoir.
Yes.
Yes.
Je voudrais avoir autre chose.
Yes.
Je voudrais avoir autre chose.
How would you say, "I would like a glass of white wine."
of white wine? Right? Right, very good. How would you say, in English you may want to say,
I would like another glass of white wine? Yes, means literally I would like another glass of white wine.
Which means if you ask a waiter, if you say that to a waiter,
je voudrais un autre verre de vin blanc, he will look at the glass and think there's something wrong with the glass,
and he will just replace the glass. Right. He will take it literally. Right. Yes.
Therefore, in French, if you want another something else, yes, another glass, yes,
you will say, I would like one more glass. Encore un verre. Encore is still more. Yes.
And you will say, encore un verre de vin blanc. So, therefore, if you want to say, I would like,
another bottle of white wine would be... Je voudrais encore...
Again, je voudrais... Je voudrais encore...
No, je voudrais... Oh, I see. Je voudrais encore...
Mm-hmm. Je voudrais encore...
Encore un... Hmm?
Encore un... Bouteille. Right.
Bouteille. Bouteille. Bouteille. Bouteille is right. Bouteille de vin blanc.
Right. Je voudrais encore une bouteille... Encore une bouteille de vin blanc. Yes. I would... I'd like one more,
another bottle of white wine. Yes. But if you say, instead of...
Encore une bouteille, you say, je voudrais... Je voudrais...
Je voudrais... N'autre bouteille de vin blanc.
Then the waiter will say, well, you had this kind of wine. Yes.
Yes. Yes.
Now you want... A different one.
A different bottle. Yes.
Of a different kind of wine. Yes.
Yeah. And he'll ask you what... What other kind of wine would you want. So... How would
you say, I would like a cup of coffee?
Je voudrais... Je voudrais... Mm-hmm. Cup?
Tasse. Tasse.
Right. Okay. So I would like a cup of coffee.
Je voudrais... Une tasse.
Je voudrais... What's more?
Je voudrais... Un tasse.
You already gave me... Je voudrais... Oh. Je voudrais... Tasse.
Je voudrais... Tasse. Je voudrais... Tasse.
Je voudrais... Tasse.
Je voudrais... Tasse. Tasse. Yes. Of coffee.
De café.
Right. Je voudrais... Tasse de café. Yes. I would like a cup of coffee.
How would you say, I would like another cup of coffee?
I would like... Tasse. Tasse. Tasse de café.
I would like... still more a cup. Encore. Tasse de café. I would like another cup of coffee. Yes.
Encore une tasse de café. Right. Very good. Je voudrais encore une tasse de café. Encore une tasse de café. I would like still more a cup. Encore une tasse de café. I would like another cup of coffee.
How would you say I would like a glass of mineral water?
Je voudrais...
A glass?
Je voudrais verre. Je voudrais...
Je voudrais un verre de... d'eau, mineral.
Very good. Je voudrais un verre d'eau, mineral. Yes.
I would like another cup, another glass of mineral water.
Je voudrais encore un verre d'eau, mineral.
Right. Je voudrais encore un verre d'eau, mineral. Yes.
Yes.
So back to the consonants.
So I repeat, je répète, I repeat.
The consonant at the end of a word in French is not sounded unless it is followed by an E,
except for the four careful consonants.
C, R, F, L.
So we started with C, like in avec, like in sac for bag,
except in C, like in blanc and franc, frank, yes.
So that's C.
Then the R, well R, like in savoir, to know, avoir, to have, voir, to see.
Venir, to come.
Partir is to leave, to depart.
Partir.
So the R is pronounced, yes.
Except for E, R.
When you have an E, R, then E, R is pronounced A.
Like parler is to speak.
P, A, R, L, E, R.
Which means that the to form of a verb, meaning the full verb in English with to, to speak, to go, to eat, yes.
Yes.
That to is expressed in the ending with an R.
Most verbs will end in E, R.
More than 90% of all verbs end in E, R.
Pronounced A.
Like to go would be...
Allé.
Allé.
Again, for the consonants, the R is sounded at the end, except with E, R.
So we have C, R, then F, like in boeuf for beef.
Yes.
And the L, we already had E, L and A, L.
Normal.
Yes.
General.
Special.
Hotel.
So we have been talking here about, about nouns.
Give the 1200 nouns and I, O, N, and the E, N, C, E, and A, N, C, about adjectives.
I, B, L, E, B, L, E, N, T, and A, N, T, and, and, and, A, N, C, and so on.
And we've been talking about verbs.
I like to avoid using grammatical terms, which I don't want to use.
Except when I'm talking about verbs, nouns, and adjectives.
But in that case, I want to make sure that we know what we're talking about.
Unfortunately, if I were to ask you what is a noun or an adjective or a verb, if you remember,
then you will remember the definitions that you had received as a child in school.
Yes.
Let's forget about the school definitions.
And say that a noun, any word in front of which you can place the article, the, is a noun.
So happiness is the noun, the happiness.
Yes.
So whenever you have the, you have a noun.
Whenever you have is or am in front of a word, you have an adjective.
Proud is an adjective.
Is proud.
I am proud.
Yes.
Any word in front of which you can place to is a verb.
Yes.
To be, to have, to sleep, and so on.
So now we can talk about nouns, adjectives, and verbs.
Yes.
Okay.
Now,
The important part I want to talk about are verbs, because if you know how to use verbs in any language, you know how to use the language.
The verbs and the use of the verbs is the backbone of the language.
The full verb, what I call the full verb, is in English usually the to form, yes, to go, to have, to be, to see, and so on.
It's also called infinitive, but whatever it's called, let's think of the full verbs, yes.
In English with to, mostly, not always, but mostly.
In French, that to form is expressed in an ending, and that ending in French ends in an R.
Either ER, which is pronounced A, where you don't sound the R, yes.
And more than 90% of all verbs in French end in A, in ER.
Veneer, to come, ending in IR.
Partir, to leave, ending in IR.
Dormir, dormant, dormitory, dormir, to sleep, ending in IR.
Savoir, O-I-R, yes.
To know, to know, to have, to see.
Comprendre.
Just to understand, to comprehend, to understand.
Ending in R-E.
Fair, we had.
To do or to make.
It's fair to do or to make.
Spelt F-A-I-R-E.
So you always have an R at the end.
Either E-R, most, again, more than 90% of all verbs, and then E-R pronounced A.
Or I-R, venir, partir, dormir.
Or R-E.
R, R-E.
Comprendre.
Fair.
Yes.
Or O-I-R, savoir, avoir, voir.
So there's always somehow an R at the end.
Yes.
E-R-I-R, O-I-R, or R-E.
Whenever you have two or three consecutive verbs in French,
you do not change the verb.
In other words, you use the full verb.
The second and the third verb automatically are in the full verb.
For instance, if you want to see,
what was, will you, is?
Voulez-vous?
Right.
Voulez-vous?
Will you or do you want?
Yes.
And what is to come is?
Venir.
Yes.
Good.
What is to eat?
Manger.
Manger, ending.
R.
Hmm?
E-R.
Of course.
Yes.
Okay.
How would you say, will you come eat with me?
Start with will you.
Voulez-vous?
Come.
Venir.
Eat.
Manger.
With me.
Avec moi.
Right.
Mm-hmm.
So you see, after voulez-vous,
the next verb in French,
you will say will you to come to eat.
Yes.
Voulez-vous venir manger?
J.
Yes.
In English, well, depending on whether you use American English or British English.
Here, in British English, you will say, will you come and eat?
Yes?
Mm-hmm.
Yes.
In American English, will you come and eat?
Yes.
But either way, in French, it's the second and third verb.
It's the full verb.
Will you to come to eat?
Voulez-vous venir manger avec moi?
Mm-hmm.
I must.
I must.
I must.
I must.
I must.
I must.
I must.
I must.
D.
Sorry.
D.
O-I-S.
O-I-S.
D-O-I-S.
Je dois.
For instance, if you want to say, I must speak with you.
Je dois parler avec vous.
Yes.
Pensement.
Say it again.
Je dois.
Speak.
Parler avec vous.
Right.
Je dois parler avec vous.
How do you spell parler at the end?
E.R.
Right.
I must to speak with you.
Je dois parler avec vous.
Yes.
How do you say, will you speak French with me?
Voulez-vous parler français avec moi?
Right.
How do you spell parler at the end?
Yeah.
Right.
Voulez-vous parler français avec moi?
Mm-hmm.
I must know where it is.
I must.
Je.
Je dois.
Je dois.
Right.
So I must know.
I don't know.
Je dois.
Sav.
Sav.
Sav.
Sav.
Sav.
Sav.
Sav.
Sav.
Right.
Je dois.
Sav.
Where?
Où?
It is.
Hmm?
C'est.
Right.
So?
So once more, I must know.
Je dois.
Know.
Je.
Yes.
Je dois.
Je dois.
Sav.
Sav.
Sav.
Sav.
Sav.
Sav.
Sav.
Where?
Où?
It is.
Ça.
C'est.
C'est.
Où c'est?
Right.
I am is je suis.
Je suis.
It's a very sweet word.
Mm-hmm.
Very sweet.
Spelt s-u-i-s.
Je suis.
I am.
If you want to say, uh, I am tired, would be, I am fatigued.
Je suis fatigué.
I am very tired now, would be.
Je suis fatigué.
I am very tired.
Je suis très fatigué.
Now?
Maintenant.
Maintenant.
Right.
Je suis très fatigué maintenant.
Mm-hmm.
The word for busy is occupé.
Occupied.
Occupé.
Occupé.
Spelt O-C-C-U-P-E.
Put an accent over the E to give it the sound of an A.
Occupé.
Yes.
So, um, I am, uh, very busy now, would be.
Je suis très occupé maintenant.
Right.
Je suis très occupé maintenant.
Mm-hmm.
How do you spell très?
T-R-E-S.
T-R-E-S with an accent over the E.
Très.
Yes.
So here you have an S, silent S, followed by a vowel.
So you can also say...
Oh, z'occupé.
Hmm?
Très occupé.
Yes.
Je suis très occupé.
Yes.
Yes.
Je suis très occupé maintenant.
Mm-hmm.
you know.
What is a little?
Petit.
No, petit means small.
A little is un...
Un peu.
Un peu is right.
So, un peu, a little.
I can has the same sound as little.
Je peux is I can.
Je peux.
Je peux.
Yes.
I can a little would be...
Je peux un peu.
Right. Je peux un peu.
Right. Je peux un peu.
So, I can and a little have the same sound.
Je peux. I can.
Je peux. Je peux.
Je peux un peu.
How would you say not now?
Pas maintenant.
Pas maintenant.
Not for me, thank you? Pas. For me? Merci. Merci, thanks. Pas pour moi, merci. I can. Je peux. Right. Thank you. Je peux. I can.
How would you say I can not? Je peux pas. Je ne. Je peux, Francois? Je peux pas. Right. Je peux pas. I can not. Yes.
But in the course of the French language, somehow, the French like to put in a signal whenever they use any negation.
A negative signal, which is only a signal, meaning a touch of an N up front.
And so instead of saying je peux pas, I can not, they would say je ne.
That N, je ne, that N means I'm going to use a negation, any negation.
Yes.
So it's just a signal.
It is, in a way, it is not a negation.
It is not in the way it is usually presented or taught as a double negation.
Yes.
No.
The N, which is spelled N-E as a separate word, but in speaking just a touch of an N, je ne, meaning I'm going to use a negation.
Je ne peux pas.
I cannot.
This does not mean that in the spoken language all French people will use that signal.
So you may not always hear it.
If you don't hear it, that means that they just didn't bother using it.
They may say je peux pas.
Je peux pas.
For I cannot.
Even the eye is just touched very lightly.
Je peux pas.
I cannot.
So if you hear that, it's still I cannot.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
So you will rarely hear French, in the spoken language, French people use the way you learn it maybe in school.
Je ne peux pas.
Yes.
No.
So it's usually je ne peux pas.
Yes.
Je ne peux pas.
Je ne peux pas.
So I am is the sweet word.
Je suis.
Je suis.
And I am not would be for the buzzer.
Je ne suis pas.
Je ne.
Je ne suis pas.
Je ne suis pas.
Je ne suis pas.
Je ne suis pas.
Yes.
Yes.
So I'm not tired now.
Je ne suis pas fatigué.
Fatigué.
Right.
Je ne suis pas fatigué now.
Je ne suis pas fatigué.
Maintenant.
Right.
Je ne suis pas fatigué.
Maintenant.

But I'm very busy now.
