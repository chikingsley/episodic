00:00-00:06
So if you want to say, why don't you come with me now?

00:06-00:11
Pourquoi...

00:11-00:18
Pourquoi pouvez-vous pas venir avec moi?

00:18-00:21
Right. Pourquoi pouvez-vous pas venir avec moi?

00:21-00:22
Yes.

00:22-00:28
So you see, it's a very useful handle, the can handle.

00:28-00:30
Yes, yes.

00:30-00:33
Another useful handle is the must handle.

00:33-00:39
If you want to say, I'm leaving, je pars, yes.

00:39-00:44
But you can say, I have to leave now, I must leave.

00:44-00:47
Je dois partir maintenant.

00:47-00:51
Right. Je dois, you use the whole verb, je dois partir maintenant, yes.

00:51-00:53
Je dois partir maintenant.

00:53-00:56
Right, yes. One must leave now, we must leave.

00:56-00:59
On doit partir maintenant.

00:59-01:01
On doit partir maintenant.

01:01-01:02
Right, on doit partir maintenant, yes.

01:02-01:04
Very useful handle.

01:04-01:08
Another one is the want handle.

01:08-01:11
Or will you, or do you want, which is...

01:11-01:12
Je veux.

01:12-01:13
Je veux.

01:13-01:14
Je veux.

01:14-01:16
And do you want?

01:16-01:17
Voulez-vous.

01:17-01:18
Voulez-vous.

01:18-01:19
Voulez-vous.

01:19-01:21
So if you want to say, why don't you do it?

01:21-01:23
You can say, why can't you do it?

01:23-01:24
Or why don't you want to do it?

01:24-01:27
Or I want to do it, I don't want to do it.

01:27-01:28
Very useful handle.

01:28-01:30
Very useful handle.

01:30-01:31
Yes.

01:31-01:32
Or I would like.

01:32-01:33
Yes.

01:33-01:34
Je vous...

01:34-01:35
What is I would like?

01:35-01:36
Je vous...

01:36-01:37
Je voudrais.

01:37-01:38
Je voudrais.

01:38-01:39

01:39-01:40
Je voudrais.

01:40-01:41
Je voudrais.

01:41-01:42
Je voudrais.

01:42-01:43
Il voudrais, and so on.

01:43-01:46
Very useful handle.

01:46-02:01
Another thing about those handles, which I want to give you now, is you can also express the past tense in using the handle in the past tense.

02:01-02:05
In English, can in the past is could.

02:05-02:06
Yes.

02:06-02:13
So instead of saying, I didn't understand you, you can say, I couldn't understand you.

02:13-02:16
The question is, what is could?

02:16-02:24
The answer is, you use, you can, which is?

02:24-02:26
Vous pouvez.

02:26-02:27
Vous pouvez.

02:27-02:33
You use that pouvez part for I, and you have je...

02:33-02:34
Je pouvais.

02:34-02:35
Je pouvais.

02:35-02:36
Je pouvais.

02:36-02:39
And je pouvais means I could.

02:39-02:44
You can gives you I could.

02:44-02:52
In spelling, you have, instead of the E-Z, E-Z, of vous pouvez, you will have pouvais with an A-I-S.

02:52-02:58
Je pouvais, I could, put in a P-O-U-V-A-I-S.

02:58-03:02
He could, il pouvait, P-O-U-V-A-I-T.

03:02-03:03
T.

03:03-03:04
Yes.

03:04-03:06
Il pouvait, yes.

03:06-03:10
So if you want to say, I couldn't understand you, would be...

03:10-03:15
Je ne pouvais pas vous comprendre.

03:15-03:16
Right.

03:16-03:18
Je ne pouvais pas vous comprendre.

03:18-03:22
So instead of, I didn't understand you, I couldn't understand you.

03:22-03:24
Je ne pouvais pas vous comprendre.

03:24-03:25
Yes.

03:25-03:27

03:31-03:48
Il ne pouvait pas, he couldn't wait for us.

03:48-03:53
He left, he had to leave.

03:53-03:59
Now you, now you do, you use the have to in the past.

03:59-04:01
How would you do that?

04:01-04:06
The vous is, would you have to?
