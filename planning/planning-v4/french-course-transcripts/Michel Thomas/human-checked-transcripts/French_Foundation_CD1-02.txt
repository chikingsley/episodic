Now, a few words about the French language. You'll get acquainted with a language that is not entirely foreign, alien to English, but there is a broad common basis of familiarity between English and French, so much so that, uh, over 60% de votre vocabulaire anglais, of your English vocabulary, comes from French. Are "d'origine française", are "of French origin". Because English is actually a mixed language, mixed between Anglo-Saxon, Germanic Anglo-Saxon, and French. The French that was brought to the, over to the British Isles with the Norman invasion. The Normans spoke French, and did so for a few hundred years. So for a few hundred years, England was bilingual, with Anglo-Saxon and French spoken. But that is n- a different story. "Pratiquement", "practically", two out of, uh, three or four words in English come from French, are "d'origine française"", are of French origin". When, uh, Alexandre Dumas, the French author, once decided to learn English, and when for the first time he looked at an English book, he noticed all those similarités, all those similarities between English and French. And he finally exclaimed, "But English is all French, badly pronounced." And he had a point, for so, because with most words, it's just a question d'accent, a question of accent. Just a différence in the prononciation, a difference in the pronunciation. So pour commencer, to start, to commence, to start, I'm going to give you a few keys to show you how you can, uh, retransformer, retransform votre vocabulaire anglais, your English vocabulary, back into French. So that within the next, uh, hour or so, you will have a starting vocabulaire, vocabulary, of, uh, between 2,000 and 3,000 words, which is not bad to begin with. Spécialement, specially, "si vous considérez", "if you consider", how "limitée", how "limited" the vocabulaire is, which we use in our everyday language. "Le vocabulaire actif", "the active vocabulary" used in our everyday language, may "varier", may "vary" between 500 and 1,500 words. It's very small. Very small. If I think of a, uh, a newspaper in New York, one of the major newspapers, where they, uh, decided years ago to, um, find out how many words they use in the whole newspaper, how many different words. And they came up with 600. All those words in English come from French. And in French, ideally is pronounced -"ible". Like "possible" would be "poss-ible". Yes. With a light touch of the l-, hardly audible touch of the L. "Poss-ible". Yes. But same spelling, same meaning. "Poss-ible". So I-B-L-E is "-ible" because the letter I is pronounced E. And A-B-L-E is pronounced "-able" because the letter A is pronounced A. "Table" is "tah-ble". "Comfortable", "comfort-able". So again, how would you say "possible" in French?

[Male Student]
Mm-hmm. 

[Michel Thomas]
Yes. 

[Female Student]

[Female Student]
Uh, that's life? 

[Male Student]

[Beep]
[beep] 

[Female Student]
C'est bon. 

[Michel Thomas]
"C'est bon". Mm-hmm. If you want to make it "very good", would be "tres bon". "Tres" means "very". So "it is very good" would be?

[Female Student]
C'est tres bon. 

[Michel Thomas]
"C'est tres bon". Mm-hmm. And "it is very comfortable"?

[Michel Thomas]
Right, "C'est acceptable". Mm-hmm. For- "for me" is "pour moi". "Pour moi". 

[Female Student]
Pour moi. 

[Michel Thomas]
Mm-hmm. "Pour" means "for". P-O-U-R. Spell P-O-U-R. "Pour moi", "for me". So "it is for me" would be?

[Beep]
[beep]. 

[Female Student]
C'est pour moi. 

[Michel Thomas]
"C'est pour moi". Yes. And "for you" would be "pour vous". "Vous" spelled V-O-U-S. "It is for you" would be?

[Michel Thomas]
"C'est pour vous". Yes. "Pour vous". "C'est pour vous". Mm-hmm. Um, "it is very comfortable for me".

[Michel Thomas]
"C'est", mm-hmm. And "it is not" is "ce n'est pas". "Ce n'est pas", it starts like a snake. It is not a snake. "Ce n'est pas", "it is not". The word for "not" by itself is "pas". Spell P-A-S. If you want to say, "Not for me, thank you," would be, "Not for me..." 

[Beep]

[Female Student]
C'est. 

[Michel Thomas]
Not... No, no, just not is...
