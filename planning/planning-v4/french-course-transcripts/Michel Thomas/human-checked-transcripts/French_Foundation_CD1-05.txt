"To go" is "aller." The English word "alley" comes from it. It's a passageway where you "alley" through. "Aller", "to go." Yes. Again, "to come" is? 

[Male Student]
Venir. 

[Michel Thomas]
"Venir." And "to go" is? 

[Male Student]
Aller. 

[Michel Thomas]
"Aller."

[Male Student]
Aller. 

[Michel Thomas]
Yes, "aller." 

[Male Student]

[Michel Thomas]
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. "Aller." So, um, how would you say, "Will you go eat with me?" 

[Male Student]
Voulez-vous- 

[Michel Thomas]
"Go" 

[Male Student]
... aller- 

[Michel Thomas]
... eat 

[Male Student]

[Michel Thomas]

[Male Student]
... avec moi? 

[Michel Thomas]
Right. "Voulez-vous aller manger avec moi?" So, "voulez-vous" means "will you." Vou-l-l you, will you. "Voulez-vous" also means "do you want." The word for "where", où is où. Où, where, où. Where. Where, où. Où. Où. Où. Just où. 

[Male Student]
Où. 

[Michel Thomas]
Yes. "Where do you want to go", would be? "Where?"

[Female Student]
Où. 

[Michel Thomas]
"Où". "do you want?" "Will you" and "do you want" is the same. What is "will you"? "Will you", "will you come with me?" "Will you", "will you"? 

[Female Student]
Voulez-vous. 

[Michel Thomas]
Right. So "voulez-vous" means "will you", "voulez-vous" also means "do you want." So again, "where do you", "where do you want to go" would be? 

[Female Student]
Où voulez-vous- 

[Michel Thomas]
"To go" 

[Female Student]

[Michel Thomas]

[Female Student]
Voulez-vous. 

[Michel Thomas]

[Female Student]
aller- 

[Michel Thomas]
"eat"

[Female Student]
manger? 

[Michel Thomas]
Right. "Où voulez-vous aller manger?" Mm-hmm. The word for "tonight," it's a beautiful word. Actually, two words. In French, you say "this evening," which is "ce soir." "Ce soir." "Ce soir," like in "soirée," "soir." "Ce soir," "this evening" or "tonight." How would you say, uh, "It is for tonight"? 

[Female Student]
C'est-

So again, "it is"?

[Female Student]
Où. 

[Michel Thomas]
"Où." "Do you want?" It's the same as "will you." 

[Female Student]
Voulez-vous.

"Le diner" means "the dinner," but "diner" by itself means "to dine" or "to have dinner." Like, uh, "where do you want to have dinner tonight?"
