Yes. Because i- it's used so much. Comme ci, comme ça means actually, so, so. Literally, comme ci, comme ça means "comme ci", "like this", like this here; "comme ça", "like that". The comme ça part, the second part of comme ci, comme ça, comme ça, is used very much in French for like that or that way. If you want to say, "It is like that," would be?
