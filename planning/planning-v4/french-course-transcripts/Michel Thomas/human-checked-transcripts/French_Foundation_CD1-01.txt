You're just about to, um, experience a new and different approach to learning, and to language learning, that will give you the practical and functional use within, uh, 10 to 12 hours of learning time. All this is achieved, and will be achieved, without memorizing. Which means there was... there's never anything to memorize, without learning by rote, without drill, without textbooks, without taking notes, and without homework. Without any mental homework. Before starting, I have to set up two ground rules. Two very important ground rules. First, it is very important for you to be relaxed, to, uh, take off, to leave off any form of tension, any form of anxiety that is usually associated with learning, and traditionally also particularly with language learning. And any form of anxiety, any form of tension inhibits true and effective learning. Before starting, the two gro- ground rules that are very important. The first ground rule is for you never to worry about remembering, and therefore never to try to remember. Because this is a method where the responsibility for your remembering is in the teaching and not with you. Not with the learner. And this is a method where the responsibility for attention is in the teaching and not with the learner. Therefore, there's no homework, not even any mental homework. It's very important not to review, even mentally, of what you've learned. Let it be absorbed and internalized to become knowledge. And what you know, you will not forget. Now come to ground rule number two that is very important too. That ground rule is that in the course I'm using two students as a teaching device in order to create a learning situation for three. You'll become the third in the group, and very quickly you will associate with the two on the tapes. You will become part of it. And it's very important, therefore, that after I introduce a concept, I will follow up in a practical way and show you how to formulate and to express thoughts in sentences. First those will be short sentences, then more and more complex and longer sentences. And whenever I say, "How do you say it?" at that point it's very important, I repeat, very important for you to use the pause button on the machine, which gives you time to think it out, to think it through, and to respond out loud. After you respond, you release the pause button. You will then get the response from one of the two students. And after that, I will repeat it so that the last impression is always what you get from me. And this is how you will experience a constant sense of progression, a constant sense of learning that you will find exciting, stimulating, and self-rewarding.
