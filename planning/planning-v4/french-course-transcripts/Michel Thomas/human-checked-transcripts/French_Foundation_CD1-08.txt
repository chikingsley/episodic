[Michel Thomas]
If you want to say, "What kind, what kind of reservation?" For "what kind," in French you say, "What sort?" "What sort" of reservation?" So, "What sort?" would be? 

[Male Student]
Quelle sorte? 

[Michel Thomas]
Right, "Quelle sorte?" 

[Male Student]
Sor- 

[Michel Thomas]
Quelle sorte? 

[Male Student]
Quelle sorte. 

[Michel Thomas]
"Quelle sorte?" "Sorte" is spelled S-O-R-T-E. Quelle sorte. And the word for "of" is "de", spelled D-E. So, "What kind of reservation do you have for me for tonight?" 

[Male Student]
Quelle s-... Uh, quelle sorte- 

[Michel Thomas]
Of reservation 

[Male Student]
... de réservation- 

[Michel Thomas]
... do you have- 

[Male Student]
... avez-vous pour moi- 

[Michel Thomas]
... for me for tonight? 

[Male Student]
... pour ce soir? 

[Michel Thomas]
Right. "Quelle sorte de réservation avez-vous pour moi pour ce soir?" What is, uh... "Will you?" 

[Female Student]
Voulez-vous? 

[Michel Thomas]
Right. And "do you want?" It's the same. 

[Female Student]
Voulez-vous? 

[Michel Thomas]
Right. How would you say, "What kind of re- what kind of reservation do you want for tonight?" "What sorte of reservation?"

[Female Student]
Quelle s- sor- 

[Michel Thomas]
Once more. 

[Female Student]
Quelle s- sor- 

[Michel Thomas]
T- 

[Female Student]
Sorte. 

[Michel Thomas]
Mm-hmm. 

[Female Student]
Quelle sorte. 

[Michel Thomas]
Of reservation? "Of" is "de."

[Female Student]
De réserv- réservation. 

[Michel Thomas]
Mm-hmm. "Do you want?" 

[Female Student]
Voulez-vous- 

[Michel Thomas]
"... for tonight?" 

[Female Student]
... pour ce soir? 

[Michel Thomas]
Right. "Quelle sorte de réservation voulez-vous pour ce soir?" We have about 1,200 nouns in English and in French ending in I-O-N. You name them, you can say them. We don't have to go through all the 1,200. Yes. Out of 1,200 we may have "trois exceptions", three exceptions out of 1,200, which is not so bad. Like, um, "translation" in French is not translation but "traduction." "Traduction." So if you want to say, uh, "I would like a translation," would be? 

[Male Student]
Je voudrais 

[Male Student]
une traduction. 

[Michel Thomas]
Right, "je voudrais une traduction." Mm-hmm. 

[Male Student]
So is that the s- traduction? 

[Michel Thomas]
Yes. 

[Male Student]
Yeah. 

[Michel Thomas]
Always at the ending, yes. 

[Male Student]
Always at, always at the end. 

[Michel Thomas]
Je voudrais une traduction. Mm-hmm. "To do" or "to make" in French is "faire." It's very faire. Very faire to do. It's very faire to make. "Faire", spelled F-A-I-R-E, "faire". Faire, faire, faire. It's faire. 

[Male Student]
Faire. 

[Michel Thomas]
"To do", it's "fair" to make. Like, um, how would you say, uh, "Will you make a reservation for me?" 

[Male Student]
Voulez-vous faire une réservation pour moi? 

[Michel Thomas]
Right. "Voulez-vous faire une réservation pour moi?" What, uh, kind of reservation do you want to make? What sort of reservation? 

[Female Student]
Quelle sorte- 

[Michel Thomas]
Mm-hmm, of. 

[Female Student]
Uh- 

[Michel Thomas]
Quelle sorte- 

[Female Student]
... de- 

[Michel Thomas]
... de réservation- 

[Female Student]
... réservation- 

[Michel Thomas]
Mm-hmm. 

[Female Student]
... réservation. 

[Michel Thomas]
Quelle sorte de réservation do you want to make? 

[Female Student]
Voulez-vous- 

[Michel Thomas]
Mm-hmm. To make. F-... To do or to make is very f-... It's very faire to do- 

[Female Student]
Faire. 

[Michel Thomas]
It's very faire to make. Yes. So, "Do you want to make," would be voulez-vous- 

[Female Student]
Voulez-vous... 

[Female Student]
faire. 

[Michel Thomas]
Right. "Quelle sorte de réservation voulez-vous faire?" What kind of reservation do you want to make? So, I said, uh, trois exceptions, three exceptions out of 1,200 ending in I-O-N. So, uh, translation is one of them. Traduction. So, uh, "Will you make a translation for me," would be? 

[Male Student]
Uh, voulez-vous- 

[Michel Thomas]
Make- 

[Male Student]
... faire- 

[Michel Thomas]
... a translation- 

[Male Student]
... une traduction pour moi? 

[Michel Thomas]
For me. Right. "Voulez-vous faire une traduction pour moi?" Mm-hmm. Another exception is explanation. Explanation in French is not explanation, but "explication." Explication. Explication. "To give" is donner. "To donate", donner. Spelled D-O double N E-R. Donner, to give. So, uh, "Will you give an explanation," would be, ex-... "Will you give an explanation for me?" 

[Female Student]
Voulez-vous- 

[Michel Thomas]
To give. To give is- 

[Female Student]
... faire? 

[Michel Thomas]
No, faire is to do or to make. 

[Female Student]
Ah. 

[Michel Thomas]
To give is to donate. 

[Female Student]
Donner. 

[Michel Thomas]
Right. Donner. So, "voulez-vous donner" an explanation? 

[Female Student]
Une explanation- 

[Michel Thomas]
Explique. 

[Female Student]
Explication. 

[Michel Thomas]
Right. "Voulez-vous donner une explication", for me? 

[Female Student]
Voulez-vous 

[Female Student]
donner une explication- 

[Michel Thomas]
For me 

[Female Student]
... pour moi? 

[Michel Thomas]
Right. "Voulez-vous donner une explication pour moi?" Yes. And the third exception out of twelve hundred in I-O-N is vacation. "Vacation" in French is "vacances." 

[Female Student]
Vacances 

[Michel Thomas]
And the french never bother with singular vacation but with vacations. It's "les vacances." les. L-E-S means "the" for plural. "Les vacances" is "the vacations."So and "to spend", to spend for time in French is a pastime. The English word pastime comes from the French. Spending time, "passé" is "to spend for time" is not for money. "To spend money" is "to dispense", "dépenser." But to spend time is "passer." "Passer le temps" is to spend the time. "To spend the vacations" would be "passé les 

[Male Student]
vacances. 

[Michel Thomas]
Pa-Passer les vacances. Yes! Yes! So "where do you want to spend the vacation" would be? 

[Male Student]
Où voulez vous? Voulez vous. 

[Michel Thomas]
To spend. 

[Male Student]
Passé. Passé. Les vacances. 

[Michel Thomas]
Les

[Male Student]
Les vacances. 

[Michel Thomas]
Right, Où voulez vous? Where do you want to pass les vacances? Yes! So how to say "the situation."

[Male Student]
