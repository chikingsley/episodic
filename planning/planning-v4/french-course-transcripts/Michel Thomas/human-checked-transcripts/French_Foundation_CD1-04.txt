Words in English ending in E-N-T and A-N-T come from French. They're the same. Same spelling, same meaning. Pronounced ung. E-N-T and A-N-T is pronounced ung. Like different would be...

[Female Student]
Différent.

[Michel Thomas]
Différent. Yes. Mm-hmm. "Important" would be? Impor-

[Male Student]
Important.

[Michel Thomas]
"Important." Yes. Mm-hmm.

[Female Student]

[Michel Thomas]
Important.

[Female Student]
Ah.

[Michel Thomas]
Yes. The I-N and I-M is pronounced ung. "Important." Yes. And the "accent", the "accent", the stress, is always softly at the end of a word in French. Always put it at the end. Yes. It may often be the diff- make, make the difference between being understood or not being understood, depending on putting the accent at the end. The stress at the end of a word. So, uh, um, "it is not very different that way" would be?

[Female Student]
Ce n'est différent.

[Michel Thomas]
Don't rush it. Think it out. "It is not."

[Female Student]
Ce n'est pas.

[Michel Thomas]
Right. You see? So again, "it is not very different."

[Female Student]

[Michel Thomas]
Right. "Ce n'est pas très différent comme ça." Mm-hmm. Yes. "But it is very important for me."

[Male Student]
Mais c'est très important pour moi.

[Michel Thomas]
Right. "Mais", "but", "c'est très", "it is very", "important", "important", "pour moi". Mm-hmm. Yes. Très is spelled T-R-É-S. Yes. The, uh, the "S" at the end of a word may be pushed over to the following word if the following word starts with a vowel, and it takes on the sound of a, of a zed, of a "Z." Yes. For instance, "very important" can be très important. Yes. But the-the "S" belongs, is hooked onto important, to the vowel. Tr- In slow motion it is très important. So it's not très. But très important. C'est très important. Yes.

[Male Student]

If you cut, then there's no push. If you cut off the très you say, "C'est très - important." Yes. Or, "C'est très important." "Evident" would be?

[Male Student]
Nécessaire.

[Michel Thomas]
Nécessaire. Nécessaire.

[Male Student]

[Male Student]

[Michel Thomas]
"With you." Uh-

[Male Student]
... avec vous.

[Michel Thomas]
Right. "Je voudrais parler français avec vous." Mm-hmm. And will you, will you please is voulez-vous. Voulez-vous. Like, vill you. Vill-voulez-vous. Will you. Will you. Yes. Actually, voulez-vous has two meanings. It means, "Will you, will you please." It also means, "Do you want." But let's use it now as will you, will you please. Voulez-vous. Like, um...
