# In-Universe Spaced Repetition Framework

## Background Systems (Always Running)

- Cultural Integration System
  - Daily life maintenance in foreign location while deep cover
  - Grocery shopping, dealing with landlords, neighborhood interactions
  - Seasonal cultural events that repeat annually with variations
  - Building genuine relationships that naturally involve repeated interaction types
- Deep Cover Maintenance System
  - Regular "practice" of cover identity to maintain believability
  - Monthly check-ins with cover job, family, social circles
  - Forgetting details of cover story creates natural repetition needs
  - Different cover identities require different language registers/vocabularies
- Intelligence Analysis Training
  - Repeatedly analyzing similar types of intercepted communications
  - Pattern recognition through exposure to variations of the same conversation types
  - Building expertise in specific domains (military communications, business negotiations, etc.)
  - Each analysis session reveals new nuances in familiar content

## Triggered Events (Scheduled for Spaced Repetition)

- Agent Assistance System Concept: Other agents need help with language tasks, triggering at optimal spaced repetition intervals
- Basic Support Types:
  - Regular support calls from agents going through familiar scenarios
  - Emergency assistance requests with time pressure
  - Scenario variety: airports, restaurants, hotels, business meetings, medical emergencies
- High-Impact Mission Types:
  - Romantic Honey Trap Coaching - Guide agents through seduction conversations for intelligence gathering (viral content potential)
  - Hostage Negotiation Coaching - Talk panicked agents through high-stakes conversations with kidnappers (viral content potential)
- Essential Mission Types:
  - Border Crossing Guidance - Help agents navigate customs interviews in real-time
  - Social Event Navigation - Guide undercover agents through embassy galas, business dinners
  - Medical Emergency Translation - Help agents communicate with foreign doctors/paramedics during crisis
  - Job Interview Coaching - Prep agents for cover identity job interviews
  - Legal Proceeding Assistance - Help agents understand court proceedings or police interrogations

Example Scheduling:

- Week 1: Big Jason Bourne airport mission (learn the skills)
- Week 3: Agent assistance call - "Help me at Lyon airport" (light refresh)
- Week 6: Another agent needs airport help (deeper reinforcement)
- Week 10: Cultural integration requires you to navigate airport yourself (application)

## Contextual Mechanics (Happen Within Missions)

- Diegetic Retries Concept: Failures are woven into the narrative fabric rather than traditional game-over screens
- Airport Scenario Example:
  - Player misses flight due to mishearing announcements
  - Narrative continues with "Your flight has been rebooked"
  - Creates natural repetition of listening exercises without breaking immersion
  - Each failure provides slightly different version of same language challenge
- Disguise/Identity System:
  - Failed conversations end with NPC refusing further interaction
  - Player returns with different disguise or identity (Mission Impossible style)
  - NPC doesn't recognize them, allowing retry attempts
  - Works especially well in spy/agent themed games
- Time-Based Natural Resets:
  - Daily situations (coffee shop orders, security checkpoints) reset each day
  - Weekly events (meetings, reports) provide regular practice opportunities
  - Seasonal events introduce variations on familiar scenarios
- Additional Retry Scenarios:
  - Medical Recovery: Food poisoning/concussion legitimately requires repeating conversations
  - Bureaucratic Red Tape: Embassy visits requiring multiple trips with different paperwork
  - Technology Failures: Recording equipment fails, forcing follow-up meetings
  - Training Simulations: In-universe VR training where handler makes you repeat until perfect
  - Parallel Investigations: Multiple similar cases requiring same conversation types

Example: Jason Bourne-Style Airport Extraction

- Setup: Player acts as experienced handler guiding rookie field agents through high-stakes airport extraction
- Pre-Mission Phase:
  - Audio briefings teaching key phrases agents will need
  - Agent profiles learned through audio dossiers
  - Mission parameters understanding (extraction points, danger zones, friendly assets)
- Mission Execution:
  - Player Role: Overwatch coordinator with live audio/video feeds
    - Monitor multiple camera angles
    - Track agent locations via GPS dots
    - Provide real-time guidance through earpiece
  - Agent Guidance Mechanics:
    - Listening tasks: Eavesdrop on security chatter to identify threats
    - Speaking tasks: Give clear, calm directions under pressure
    - Decision points: Choose which agents to prioritize when situations overlap
    - Stress management: Keep agents calm through tone and word choice
  - Dynamic Scenarios:
    - Security checkpoint complications
    - Suspicious behavior detection
    - Crowd navigation during delays
    - Emergency route changes
    - Asset identification in crowds

Example: Network Down Emergency Scenario

- Setup: Communication networks compromised; agents need help identifying contacts through conversation analysis
- Player Role: Remote Identification Specialist using video calls and audio feeds
- Core Mechanics:
  - Listening Activities:
    - Conversation eavesdropping through agent's phone
    - Voice pattern recognition (accents, speech patterns, nervous tells)
    - Topic analysis (code words, shared references, suspicious deflections)
    - Background audio analysis (other conversations, ambient sounds)
  - Speaking Tasks:
    - Agent coaching on what questions to ask
    - Real-time analysis: "Person at table 3 mentioned Prague - that's your contact"
    - Warning alerts: "Stop talking, someone's recording you"
    - Extraction calls when situations go bad
- Mission Variations:
  - Caf√© rendezvous: Multiple potential contacts, identify the real one
  - Diner surveillance: Spot hostile surveillance while maintaining cover
  - Public transit: Moving environment, limited time windows
  - Hotel lobby: Formal setting, higher stakes, more sophisticated players
