# Social Dynamics System

## Core Mechanic: Relationship Meters

Instead of explicit "approach choices," players manage **ongoing relationship meters** with multiple targets:

### Relationship Types

- **Trust Level** - How much they confide in you
- **Emotional Investment** - How attached they are to you  
- **Suspicion Level** - How much they question your motives
- **Dependency** - How much they rely on you for support

## The Three Intel Targets Structure

- Target A: Street Level (underground/informal)
  - Vocabulary: Slang, street talk, cultural references
  - Time commitment: Spontaneous hangouts, irregular schedule
  - Risk profile: High trust/high suspicion dynamic
- Target B: Corporate/Formal
  - Vocabulary: Business jargon, technical terms, professional discourse
  - Time commitment: Scheduled meetings, networking events
  - Risk profile: Professional reputation, predictable but scrutinized
- Target C: Social/Personal
  - Vocabulary: Intimate conversation, emotional language, personal stories
  - Time commitment: Relationship maintenance, emotional availability
  - Risk profile: Deep emotional manipulation, highest guilt factor

## Consequence Layers (Multi-Meter System)

### 1. Language Retention

- **Use it or lose it** - Vocabulary degrades without practice
- Different domains decay at different rates
- Emergency lookup options available but costly

### 2. Cover Sustainability

- **How long can you maintain the lies?**
- Complex stories become harder to track
- Contradictions accumulate over time
- Each target cross-references your behavior

### 3. Time Management

- **Competing demands for your attention**
- Missing meetings has relationship consequences
- Can't be in two places at once
- Priority choices reveal character patterns

### 4. Emotional Toll

- **Leading people on has psychological cost**
- Player character develops stress/guilt meters
- Affects performance in other interactions
- Can lead to mission compromise or conscience breaks

### 5. Intel Quality

- **Better relationships = better information**
- Surface-level connections yield surface intel
- Deep trust unlocks critical mission data
- Quality vs. quantity trade-offs

## Real-Time Pressure Elements

### Missed Meeting Consequences

- Romantic Target: "Why didn't you text back? I thought we had something special."
- Business Target: "This is unprofessional. It reflects poorly on both of us."
- Street Target: "Thought you were solid, my mistake. Word gets around."

### Competing Time Demands

Multiple targets making simultaneous demands:

- Target A wants to hang out tonight (spontaneous)
- Target B scheduled important business dinner (planned)
- Target C needs emotional support during crisis (urgent)

**Player can only choose one** - others react accordingly to being deprioritized.

## The Cheating/AI Assistance Dynamic

### In-Moment Vocabulary Challenges

- Options when you don't know a word/phrase:
  - Look up vocabulary on phone - Breaks immersion, raises suspicion
  - Wing it with limited vocabulary - Authentic but risky communication
  - Use AI translation - Efficient but obvious to native speakers
  - Ask for clarification - Shows honesty but reveals gaps

### Context-Dependent Consequences

- Business meeting: Looking things up might be professionally acceptable
- Romantic dinner: Phone use completely kills the intimate vibe
- Street connection: "Why you acting all fake all of a sudden?"

## Natural Polarization System

Player **behavior patterns** organically create character archetypes without explicit choices:

### Emerging Archetypes

- The Operator
  - Always prioritizes mission efficiency over relationships
  - Uses AI assistance frequently
  - Maintains emotional distance
  - High intel quality, low relationship sustainability
- The Infiltrator
  - Gets genuinely invested in people and causes
  - Avoids technological shortcuts
  - High emotional toll but deep cover
  - Risk of "going native"
- The Perfectionist
  - Over-prepares for every interaction
  - Studies extensively, rarely improvises
  - High performance but inflexible when plans change
  - Struggles with spontaneous relationship demands
- The Improviser
  - Wings it, relies on charm over preparation
  - Adapts quickly but makes mistakes
  - High authenticity, inconsistent intel gathering
  - Vulnerable to exposure through accumulated small errors

## Core Game Loop

### Phase 1: Intel Gathering

- **Choose which relationship to prioritize** this cycle
- Review available intel and mission objectives
- Assess current relationship states and time commitments

### Phase 2: Language Prep

- **Study relevant vocabulary** using spaced repetition system
- Preview upcoming interaction context
- Choose preparation depth vs. time investment

### Phase 3: Social Interaction

- **Real-time conversation** with vocabulary challenges
- Time pressure for responses
- Relationship meter changes based on performance
- Opportunities for intel gathering or relationship building

### Phase 4: Consequence Assessment

- **See how choices affected ALL relationships**
- Review intel gathered vs. relationship costs
- Time-sensitive follow-up requirements emerge
- Character archetype reinforcement

### Phase 5: Mission Progress

- **Unlock new intel** based on relationship success
- Access to new vocabulary domains
- Story branches based on relationship configurations
- Preparation for next cycle

## V1 Implementation Focus

### Scope Definition

- Three Intel Targets, Five Interaction Opportunities Each
  - 15 total scripted interactions
  - Systematic relationship progression
  - Clear vocabulary domains for each target type
  - Real-time meeting system with competing demands

### Key Systems to Implement

1. **Competing time demands** - Core tension mechanic
2. **Vocabulary lookup consequences** - Meta-commentary on language learning
3. **Relationship meter tracking** - Multiple parallel progressions
4. **Natural archetype emergence** - Character definition through action patterns
5. **Intel quality scaling** - Mechanical reward for relationship investment

## Design Philosophy

The Central Question: "What kind of person do you become when you have to lie for a living?"

This system creates emotional investment through relationship consequences while teaching language through contextual necessity rather than abstract study. The pressure of maintaining multiple covers while competing for limited time creates natural dramatic tension and forces meaningful choices about priorities and methods.
