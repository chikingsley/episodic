# Chants of Sennaar – language-learning core loop

## Core Loop Stages

### 1. First contact

Arrives in a zone where all signage and speech bubbles are glyphs. Each new glyph that appears is auto-copied into the player’s notebook.

Instant immersion → forces “comprehensible zero input” so every later hint feels like progress.

Start every chapter with an opaque block of target-language content to create curiosity tension.

### 2. Free noting / hypothesis

In the notebook the player can type any guess next to a glyph; that guess then overlays future dialogue so the text becomes a mix of glyphs + guesses.

Promotes generation effect: making one’s own guess deeply encodes the form.

Give learners a quick-edit lexicon where they can write a gloss, a mnemonic, a drawing, anything. Keep it low-friction (1-click edit).

### 3. Context harvest

Players roam, watching NPCs mime, reading pictorial signs, listening to repeated phrases.

Multiple varied contexts = natural spaced repetition without drills.

Seed every unknown word in 3–5 different micro-contexts (animation, UI hint, short quest).

### 4. Validation spread

Periodically a double-page pops up: 3–5 sketches (e.g., a guard saluting, a door) + the relevant glyphs. Drag-match the glyph to the sketch. If all matches are right, the set locks-in and future dialogue swaps the glyphs for the confirmed word.

Gives a clear success “ding”, removes ambiguity, and acts as spaced test moments.

Drop “checkpoint cards” that auto-test clusters of words instead of single flash-cards. Require 100 % correctness to lock them, but allow infinite retakes.

### 5. Structural clues

Some scripts reuse radicals/affixes (e.g., a curved stroke = “tool”, underline = verb). Players spot the pattern themselves; the game never explains it explicitly.

Implicit grammar discovery through visual clustering (inductive learning).

Encode real-language morphology visually (color, icons, prefixes) so players intuitively group forms before you ever name the rule.

### 6. Knowledge-gated puzzles

Doors, stealth terminals, & cross-culture translators only open if the player enters the right phrase in the new language.

Forces active recall in a meaningful task (communicative purpose).

Gate story beats behind tiny production tasks (type the polite request, choose the right honorific, etc.).

### 7. Multilingual bridges

Later floors contain bilingual signs or machines that show Floor N glyphs ⇄ Floor N-1 glyphs. This lets players cross-check hypotheses and highlights syntactic differences.

Comparative noticing: seeing two versions side-by-side sharpens grammar awareness.

Re-use earlier vocabulary as subtitled L1 lines, or show parallel text to highlight word order / particles.

### 8. Difficulty ramp

Each floor adds a twist: new word order (OSV for Bards), compound glyphs, incomplete sentences, stealth under pressure, etc.

Keeps cognitive load balanced—just as decoding feels easy, a new linguistic wrinkle appears.

Plan incremental “rule reveals” every chapter (e.g., first nouns, then plurals, then past tense…).

## Why it works (educational lens)

* Inductive discovery – Learners infer meaning before any overt teaching, mirroring real-life L2 immersion.
* Immediate hypothesis feedback – Correct matches rewrite the world instantly, a powerful reward loop.
* Contextualized repetition – The same word shows up in dialogue, UI prompts, puzzles, and scenery.
* Intrinsic motivation – Decoding = progress. Story advancement and mechanical access depend on comprehension, not XP bars.
* Cognitive scaffolding – Only ~5 words are ever tested at once, preventing overload while still feeling substantial.
