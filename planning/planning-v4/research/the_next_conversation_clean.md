## Prologue

The worn-out Berber carpet of the old ranch house felt scratchy on my legs. Wearing an oversize shirt and my Spider-Man underwear, I curled up into a ball in the corner of the main room. My hair and skin were still wet from my rushed, unheated shower. I was shivering. I was also grinning ear-to-ear. Eight-year-old me wasn't going to miss a thing.

Everyone was in the main room. The patriarch of the family was my great-grandfather, who was a federal judge. My grandfather, father, first cousins, great uncles—you name it—were all trial lawyers. Every year, the Fisher men would get together for an opening-weekend hunt in the Hill Country of West Texas. There were thirteen joining in total, and for the first time, I made it fourteen. I felt like I had been called up to the big leagues. Me—finally old enough to go on an eight-hour drive with my dad listening to James Taylor, Jim Croce, and Jerry Jeff Walker. Me—finally old enough to be around the big boys.

I hardly spoke a word, mind you, but it didn't matter. I drank IBC Root Beer and ate more beef jerky than my momma would ever have allowed. The first night was an experience cemented into my memory. As dinner finished, my grandfather put his plate down and scooted to the edge of his couch seat. He began to tell a story. Something about his job, a judge, and a courthouse. I immediately recognized it as the same story he had told my dad earlier that day while we were fixing an old deer blind. Earlier, though, the story was more matter-of-fact. His voice came out plain as he told it while searching for green paint in his truck bed.

But this was special. It was the same words, but it was a very different story. I was entranced, watching as he stood up to reenact a scene. He used his hands and face to give texture to his voice. His volume went up on the exciting parts, low and slow on the intense parts. Even his tone changed. Could this be the same story?

He captivated the room for nearly ten minutes. After a long pause, he delivered the punch line, and the room filled with laughter. I felt as though I had seen a magic show. The end of his story opened the floor to others as one by one my cousins, dad, and even my great-grandfather took turns with courtroom stories of their own. As trial lawyers, they were all wonderful storytellers. The laughter went on for hours into the night.

I sat there in that corner transfixed by every story, every word, with my knees tucked into my sleep shirt. I took it all in until I fell asleep. It was late. My dad carried me off to bed, beef jerky still in my hand.

The whole evening for me had been the discovery of something new yet strangely familiar, as if I had seen it all before. I remember it immediately felt right to me, like a shoe that fit the first time you tried it on. That night, and for the next ten years of opening weekends, I received my family's inheritance: a passed-on identity dedicated to advocacy through storytelling. I realized with each year gone by that law was only the family profession—communication was the true family passion.

To no one's surprise, I wanted to go to law school and become a trial lawyer. And after practicing for ten years, I still don't know of another profession like it. I get hired to handle problems with people I personally don't have problems with. What's more, the opposing party also has their own lawyer, who's getting paid to have problems with me. Every day, I go up against people whose primary job is to make sure that I lose.

When it comes to a jury trial, the stakes can't be any higher. How I communicate, and how I teach my client to communicate, can mean the difference between recovering their livelihood and losing it forever. Each case is a new lesson, whether I'm deposing witnesses, cross-examining parties, or giving arguments before a judge or jury. My entire purpose is to run toward conflict.

If you're inclined to believe that I learned my communication skills in law school, don't. Law school teaches you how to apply the law: principles of contracts, torts, constitutional law, and state and federal rules of procedure—all important. But you won't sit in a class on how to speak to each other with empathy. You won't hear a lesson on how to defuse a heated argument. Law school teaches you how to read the law. It doesn't teach you how to read people. I had to learn that part myself.

"Do you yike it?!" my sister, Sarah, squealed through her pacifier as she brought me the fifth round of invisible pancakes. As the oldest of four, I loved being the big brother. By the time I was thirteen, my bond with my siblings was so strong that they obeyed me almost better than they did my parents. I was like a mother hen wherever we went. And by the time I was sixteen, I was driving them to school while going over their spelling words.

To be clear, my parents are loving and wonderful. I was only as good as I was because they poured so much of themselves into me those first four years before my sister was born. I also just truly enjoyed the responsibility of being the big brother. Being the oldest supposedly leads to more emotional stability, initiative, and the like. But for me, it taught me to hone communication fundamentals at an early age.

I quickly learned to acknowledge Sarah by pretending to gobble up the invisible food while smiling and saying, "Mm-hmm, delicious." I found that words of kindness worked better at getting her to open up than words of anger. My younger brother Jonathan would say my name repeatedly (they call me Bubba, a southern term of endearment for the eldest boy) and stammer until he got his sentences out. I learned that if I patiently waited and repeated his words back to him while nodding my head, he felt understood. He also couldn't say his consonants for a long time, only vowels. I naturally became his interpreter, identifying nonverbal mannerisms and foreseeing situations that would frustrate him before they happened.

Jacob, my youngest brother, was the most emotionally intense of the three. He felt his emotions big, quickly losing his temper. I figured out that if I slowed my words and lowered my voice, so would he. I learned to let him feel his feelings without me taking them personally. That sometimes a hug said more than any words I could say.

Each sibling had a unique personality that took a special approach, a special touch to connect with them on a deeper level. One of the most critical skills that I developed as the oldest was my ability to mediate and resolve conflict. If two of my siblings began arguing over our sister's Polly Pocket, I'd quickly stop the yelling, have them each give their side of the story, and then make the judgment call on whose turn it was and what the compromise would be. And it worked.

I became proficient at teaching my siblings how to communicate their needs and understand the needs of one another. Serving as the role model for communication between my siblings was daily life. Now married with two kids, it's still daily life. I've been the communicator in every phase, every relationship, every friend group. Maybe you think it's just a knack for talking. I know it to be something more.

Every night as I was growing up, my dad sat on the edge of my bed, leaned over, and whispered, "Dear God, give Jefferson wisdom and always be his friend." I believe in the power of prayer. And I believe that without my parents' prayer, you wouldn't be reading this book.

In 2020, I made partner at a prestigious defense firm. But despite this achievement, I was professionally depressed. I always came back to the same metaphor: I felt like I was running with a parachute. I was billing and working cases, yes, but creatively, I was getting nowhere. To make things harder, my dad worked at the same firm. When I first told him I had thoughts of going off on my own, let's just say it didn't go well. Honestly, it didn't go well for the next twenty conversations and even up to when I announced it to the firm. He fought for me to stay. Those were hard talks.

I did two things in January 2022 that would change everything. First, I opened my own law firm, Fisher Firm, handling personal injury cases. I didn't have an office or an assistant—heck, I didn't even have a printer. I surfed coffee shops with my laptop and borrowed friends' empty offices. I quickly signed up clients, and man, did it feel amazing. I got to help real people with real problems. I'd cut the parachute, and I was finally making up ground.

Second, I made my first social media post giving communication advice. Originally, I wanted to use it to generate leads. I saw so many lawyers posting on social media doing the only thing they knew: selling. They saw it as the new billboard frontier, telling people what to do and who to call after an accident. I even tried some of it myself. But afterward, it just didn't feel right.

My mind flashed to those attorneys whose faces are splattered on billboards, seen holding hammers, flamethrowers, and boxing gloves, saying outrageous things like "Have you been injured? I'm the Texas Cheese Grater! Call me and get that cheddar now!" Blerf. I shuddered. I can't stand that stuff. Most of all, that wasn't me.

I chose a different path. Instead of selling myself, I would provide value for free. Not about what would benefit me, but about what would benefit other people. And this time, I would do it being authentically me, the person I've been all along. Jefferson.

How could I truly help people? It needed to be something relatable, a message of light and good into people's homes and workplaces. My mind flashed back to my parents' question to me whenever I didn't know what to say to someone: "Well, what do you want them to know?"

The answer hit me like a ton of bricks. I'd tell them what I know better than anyone else I knew. I'd help them learn how to communicate.

I didn't have a cool desk setup or a studio to record in with a fancy camera, but I had my truck and my phone. That'd have to do. I turned my phone selfie-style and pressed record. I decided on the fly that it would be "How to argue like a lawyer pt.1" and that I'd boil it down to three easy points. In the front seat of my empty truck, I talked to the screen of my phone about how to keep your questions shorter, how to be less emotionally reactive, and how too much cursing was like over-seasoning your food.

I'd run across something previously that said that a video needed to have a call to action. So, at the end of the video, I said, "Try that and follow me." For whatever reason, I couldn't tell you why, I put my hand up to my mouth at the last second when I said it. I decided to roll with it.

I took a big gulp and posted the forty-seven-second clip to social media. I didn't expect anything to happen. So far, all my videos had zero views. In fact, I'd even googled "Why do my videos have 0 views?" and "How do I make a reel?"

What happened next was nothing I was prepared for. After an hour passed, my "how to argue" video started ramping up in views, quickly reaching into the thousands. The next day, it was in the millions. I didn't realize, of course, that it would also mean that millions of people would see my daughter's pink car seat and my son's sippy cup in the back, along with my thoughtless fashion choice—an unstructured polo with a suit jacket. Who gets dressed thinking they're going to be seen by millions of people that day?

People didn't seem to care. It was where I was in my life. It made them feel like I was speaking directly to them, with no upsell, no gimmicks. It was real. "What do I do now?" I asked a friend. She replied, "You make more." So I did.

That year, I gained more than five million social media followers, including hundreds of celebrities and public figures, all while using my iPhone from my driver's seat to give communication advice. Always the same way—alone, in my car, wherever I could park between leaving the law firm and arriving home. Never scripted, always posted on the same day that I filmed. No video editor or fancy graphics or trendy captions. Just me, holding my phone and being myself.

And despite doing everything alone in my car, I soon found myself in front of thousands of real people giving keynotes at conferences and speaking to organizations asking to learn from my communication techniques. I even spoke at NASA. Every time I spoke, all I could think was, "What are all y'all doing here?"

I reached 250,000 email subscribers wanting my weekly communication tip, and I signed a book deal with Penguin Random House to start writing the book you're holding now. I launched The Jefferson Fisher Podcast, which shot straight to the top of the charts and is the number one communication podcast in the world. I've also grown an amazing online community filled with resources and classes that equip people with practical ways to improve their communication.

My videos have received over half a billion views across all platforms. I'm blessed and humbled to have received some of the kindest, most thoughtful daily messages of thanks and gratitude. I can't believe I get to help others in this way, much less that I'm typing these words.

I still practice law every day, now helping people from all over the US with their personal injuries and connecting them to attorneys I trust. I still record a short video every day. I still say, "Try that and follow me." Millions have tried it and followed me. I say that from a deep place of gratitude. I never dreamed this is where it would go. But the dreams didn't stop there.

Five months after I opened Fisher Firm, my dad left his firm of thirty-five years to join me, his son, for no other reason than simply for us to practice law together. "You still got room for the old man?" he asked with a smile. I was speechless. There was nothing I could've ever wanted more. My eyes still well up with happy tears now as I write about it.

## Introduction

Not long after uploading my first video, I started to receive messages—thousands of them. So many that there was no way I could read, let alone respond to, all of them. The messages were from followers of my content asking me for advice. They weren't asking for my guidance on big philosophical questions about religion or politics, or even legal stuff. They wanted my advice on the day-to-day, micro moments about real things that real people struggle with, everything from mundane issues to stories that'll rip your heart out.

- What do I say to a superior who always puts down my ideas?
- What do I say to my adult daughter who I haven't seen in years?
- What do I say to my partner, who always has to be right?

After thousands of messages like these, the one thing I've learned is that no matter how they frame the question, their problem isn't what to say—it's **how to say it**.

Whenever I get one of these questions, the first thing I ask is what my parents always asked me: "Well, what do you want them to know?" So far, I've never received back, "I don't know." I always get a quick answer. People already know what they want to say, because deep down, it's a reflection of what they're already feeling:

- I want them to know it hurts me.
- I want them to know I need space.
- I want them to know why I'm upset.

The feelings reveal themselves naturally. But articulating those feelings to another person? Not so easy. It's deflating, really, how something so simple can feel so out of reach.

If you picked up this book, chances are you're reaching for the same thing: real solutions for real problems. You don't need the **what**, you need the **how**. How do you express yourself in a way that respects both your perspective and the perspective of the other person? How do you stand up for yourself without losing the relationship? How do you voice your thoughts with authenticity and empathy but still show that you have a backbone?

The easy answer you're looking for is connection. The more honest answer you deserve is in the pages that lie ahead.

## Why I Wrote This Book

I wrote this book for three reasons:

1. Because my social media followers asked for it. To me, it's their book.
2. To teach you what I know that will improve your next conversation.
3. To preserve a piece of me for my kids and my family.

Before you crack into it, I need you to understand something important. The communication skills in this book aren't borrowed principles. Outside of a few studies and commentary from other scientific fields—psychology, neuroscience, behavioral science—you won't be seeing many sources. What you're about to read is knowledge collected from my life experiences and how I communicate.

I am not a therapist. I am not a psychologist. If anything I say in this book somehow conflicts in some way with one of these specialists, believe them over me. I'm not going to ask you to identify your attachment style or encourage you to take a quiz to find out which conflict personality you have. If you're looking to take a deep dive into the latest statistics or a case study about how the social dynamic patterns of bees can help you communicate, I'm not the guy for you.

What I've written are lessons from my daily grind in the real-world trenches of arguments, disagreements, heated debates, and difficult conversations. What I offer is down-to-earth, homegrown advice outside of the textbooks and lectures. And maybe that's just what more of the world needs.

## How This Book Will Help You

While I am a trial lawyer, you won't find a speck of law in what you're about to read. This book isn't about my profession, or even about lawyers. It's about how to speak boldly, with your chin up, to embrace the vulnerability that comes with laying all your cards on the table. How to say what you mean and mean what you say. It's about choosing courage over comfort, even when your voice shakes.

Speaking directly doesn't mean you lack empathy or consideration for the other person's feelings. Being direct means that you have the self-assurance that you can respect the other person, as well as yourself, enough to communicate your needs openly without fear.

You don't have to be an assertive person to speak assertively. The words do it for you. That's what this book will give you: the words.

In this book, you'll get answers to questions that so many people wrestle with:
- How do I talk to someone who's defensive?
- What do I say when someone belittles me?
- How do I assert my boundaries?

To get you there, I've broken it down into two parts. Part one tells you how to first connect with yourself. That sounds woo-woo, I know. But it's not. It's about where to go in your mind when conflict appears, and most important, how to leverage the mindset for better outcomes. Part two teaches you how to use that leverage to connect with other people. How you connect looks different based on context, whether it's working through a difficult conversation or needing to stand up for yourself.

Whatever context you find yourself in, I've created three rules that will build the connection for you:

1. **Say it with control.**
2. **Say it with confidence.**
3. **Say it to connect.**

Behind each rule are proven tactics you can use immediately. Throughout this book, I'll show you what confident communication looks, sounds, and feels like. You'll learn from real-life stories from my personal and professional experiences. You'll also see yourself in hypothetical conversations that hit close to home. You'll learn what to say and what not to say, and of course, how to say it.

After reading the pages ahead, you're going to be able to remove the difficult from difficult conversations, making space for more real in your life. Real friendships, real connection, and real growth. And I don't just mean at home or in relationships. You'll find the real you starting to show up at work and in meetings. You'll respond to texts and emails differently. People will know where you stand. You'll watch your confidence turn into credibility—and that, I can't wait to see.

## How to Apply This Book

While reading this book or watching any of my videos, you may ask: How will I remember all this when I need it? My answer is simple: you won't. You can't read everything and expect to immediately apply everything. That's too much at once, like trying to drink from a firehose. You'll set yourself up for failure.

Instead, pick one. Pick one tip that resonates with you and apply it as soon as you can. For example, let's say the lesson that hits home with you is the one about over-apologizing, in chapter seven. Focus on that one lesson. Find ways to keep it close to your thoughts, like writing it down somewhere you can see, saying it out loud to yourself, or telling a close friend who can keep you accountable. Then, start using it. Catch yourself every time you give a needless "sorry" and edit it out of every sentence you say, email you type, or message you text. Commit yourself to that one rule.

Then, and only then, when you can go a week without a single unnecessary apology, should you move on to another lesson that also resonates with you.

This book includes tips I've handpicked, from my most popular and viral videos to exclusive takeaways I've never shared before. If you're reading this because you follow me on social media, hi, it's still me. I'm proud to finally give you something tangible to mark up, tear up, and make yours. I know you'll find it worth the wait.

It's time to say more of what you mean and mean more of what you say. It's time to communicate your needs openly without fear. So come hop in to the passenger seat, and I'll bring the IBC Root Beer and beef jerky. You're well on your way to making your next conversation the one that changes everything.

# Part I: The Essentials

I don't need to convince you that communication matters. You know that. What I do need to persuade you of, however, is the reach of it. Your words have a ripple effect.

It doesn't matter how insignificant you think you are—whether you think you're a somebody or a nobody, your words have power beyond anything you'll live to see. How you talk to your coworker, or the person behind the counter, affects how they talk to their friends and their family when they go home. How you talk to your kids affects how they will talk to their kids. Your words don't just matter now. They matter to generations of people you'll never meet. People you'll never know exist.

The right sentence to the right person can change lives. Yes, actions can speak louder than words, but they're not a replacement for them. You can't call yourself a kind person if you don't use kind words. Who do your words say you are? The ripples keep going long after the rock hits the water.

What you'll learn in The Essentials is a mindset that prepares you to create waves of positive impact that will resonate through your relationships to last a lifetime, and many times over.

## Chapter 1: Never Win an Argument

"I don't trust you as far as I can throw you!" he bellowed. In all honesty, it was a compliment. He could've thrown me pretty far.

In his tan coveralls with a white oval patch that had "LaPray" embroidered in black on the upper left pocket, Bobby LaPray glared at me with enough heat to burn a hole through my suit jacket. I generally don't know what someone looks like before I meet them at their deposition. Whatever I pictured Bobby LaPray looking like, it wasn't this.

Sitting at the conference room table waiting for people to arrive, I looked up to see a half human, half giant. His outline took up the whole doorway. Naturally, I stood up and walked over to him to shake his hand and introduce myself.

"Jefferson Fisher," I said with a smile.

"Hmph. Bobby," he muttered.

Now, I'm not a small guy. I'm over six feet tall. But I barely came up to Bobby LaPray's chest. He was an absolute mountain. As we shook hands, the squeeze from his ginormous callused hands left an imprint on mine like a scene from a Tom and Jerry cartoon. I'd never been around someone so physically intimidating.

The case involved a bar fight, and I was representing a bystander who had gotten caught up in the scuffle. As part of the case, I needed to depose Bobby LaPray, a witness to the events. In a deposition, I get the chance to ask people questions under oath, typically to learn what they know before they testify at trial.

Clockwise around the antique conference room table sat the court reporter writing everything down, Bobby LaPray, the opposing attorney, and me. After asking Bobby to raise his right hand and placing him under oath, the court reporter gave her customary nod for me to begin.

I asked Bobby LaPray routine questions about his background and what had led up to the fight. They were easy, open-ended questions: What time did you arrive? Who did you talk to first? Did you see so-and-so or do this-and-that? It's common to use such questions to build a chronology of the events from a witness's particular point of view.

At all times, I made sure I was kind and polite—90 percent because that's my personality and 10 percent out of sheer self-preservation. He was not someone I wanted upset. But no matter how many softball questions I asked, Bobby LaPray was becoming increasingly agitated.

I had seen it enough times in my experience to know. His eyebrows began furrowing with each answer. A sign of negative emotion. His breathing got heavier as he switched from exhaling through his nose to exhaling through his mouth. A sign of increased stress. He started wringing his massive hands together as he spoke. A sign of anxiety.

It didn't matter what I did. It seemed as if just my existence in the room offended him. I could sense the tension around the table heightening the more displeased Bobby LaPray looked. Like I was blowing up a balloon and it was about to pop.

Finally, I asked him, "Mr. LaPray, would you like a break?"

The room went silent.

"No," Bobby LaPray said, clearing his throat. "But I got something to say."

His words rang out louder than necessary. So much so that the court reporter jumped. I quickly glanced at the other attorney, who couldn't have been younger than sixty-five. He looked more nervous than I was. When we locked eyes, he gave me a wide-eyed look and slowly shook his head as if to say, "If this goes south, you're on your own."

I turned back to look at my witness.

"Yessir?" I inquired.

Bobby LaPray took a big breath in. "You can cut all this buddy-buddy stuff." Except he didn't say "stuff." "You lawyers are the worst thing to happen to America," he continued. "All you do is lie." He slammed his hand on the table, then drew it upward with a pointed finger at me, saying, "So go on and ask me your stupid questions. Just know, I don't trust you as far as I can throw you! I'm tellin' you, lawyers are the worst thing to happen to this country," he repeated.

The court reporter gave an anxious look.

At that moment, a hundred thoughts raced through my mind. First, I'm well accustomed to this derogatory stereotype of attorneys, especially personal injury attorneys. I try very hard to work against it, though it's a reputation that some attorneys, frankly, rightly deserve. So a put-down joke or snide remark about my profession is nothing new. I understood.

Second, I didn't blame him for not trusting me. Not because I was trying to mislead him, but because to his mind, I represented all the bad things he ever thought he knew or had heard of about the law, lawyers, and "the system." Of course he had no reason to trust me. I understood.

It was the "stupid questions" that got me. I know good and well that I do many, many stupid things every day. But what I don't do is ask stupid questions. In that instant, a wave of anger surged through me. I felt my whole body go tense. My ears got hot as I shifted my weight in my seat. I could sense that I was becoming defensive. My questions up to that point had barely scratched the surface. Nothing about them had been difficult or even uncomfortable.

*Stupid? I'll show him stupid*, I thought. I felt myself wanting to come back with quips about his size in relation to his intelligence. Just a few well-placed cutting words and I'd best him.

I tried to tell myself that his reaction was all I needed to know about who he truly was. But I'd been wrong before.

When I was in third grade, my school started a reading buddy program, pairing strong readers with those who hadn't learned yet. That's how I got paired with Evan. Twice a week, we'd sit on beanbags during our library period. I'd listen as he would struggle to read aloud books like *Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?* by Bill Martin Jr.

Evan was physically much bigger than I was. Back then, I had a hard time understanding how he was so big but couldn't read. When he'd come across a word he didn't know, my job was to help him sound it out. But he still struggled. So I figured out ways to explain things to him differently, like associating words with memorable phrases or creating metaphors on the fly with whatever was near us in the room. I got good at crafting little tricks that engaged Evan's interests, making harder ideas more memorable.

Sometimes we'd do our reading sessions during our lunch period. While I'd pull out my lunch in a brown bag with a handwritten smiley face on it that my momma had made me that day, I'd watch as a teacher would bring him a tray from the cafeteria. Evan's momma didn't make his lunch. I began to notice that his clothes never seemed to fit him, like they were three sizes too big.

Once, when we were going over *throw*, *threw*, and *through*, I tried to help by relating it to how he'd throw a ball to his dad. Evan flatly replied, "I don't know who my dad is."

I vividly remember feeling as though I couldn't move my mouth. I was speechless. My heart broke for him. I'd later learn that Evan had been living with his grandparents. His dad had left shortly after he was born. His mom was in jail. But in third grade, I had no grasp of his reality. No clue about the true struggles he was facing.

With two loving parents who read and told stories to me at night, I knew then that he was living in a world I knew nothing about. As we continued over that fall semester and into the next year, Evan's reading level improved with each session until he was reading all on his own. I couldn't have been prouder.

Exposure to Evan's inner struggles was another defining moment in my life at an early age. And it was a lesson I've never forgotten.

Zinging a put-down at ten-foot-tall Bobby wouldn't help anything. It would only hurt—if not the deposition, then most definitely my face. And besides, my client's case needed this information.

*Put it down, Jefferson*, I said to myself. I let out a long, silent breath through my nose. As I dropped the tension in my shoulders, my thoughts of retaliation faded. What I became more curious about, however, was the disproportionality of his reaction.

Anytime someone takes a level one conversation and jumps it up to level ten, it's telling. And what it tells you is that there's another conversation happening inside that person's head that you weren't invited to. Something hidden has taken over their filter and is now driving their reactions. You're only seeing the tip of the iceberg.

*What else is at play? Who am I really talking to?* I intended to find out.

Having let about ten seconds pass from his last words—"lawyers are the worst thing to happen to America"—I gave a soft smile and said slowly, "Well, maybe you're right."

I waited another ten seconds as I sat back in my chair and moved my gaze around the room. When I was ready, I leaned forward and put my forearms on the table.

"Tell me, please. What's been your biggest struggle this year?" I asked.

Bobby LaPray's eyes looked up to meet mine. "Say what?" he scoffed.

I repeated, "What's been your biggest struggle—personal struggle—this year?"

At that question, Bobby LaPray slowly dropped all emotion from his face. He got very still. I stayed quiet while his eyes seemed to search for the words. After a while, he finally spoke. His words stumbled out, choppy and hesitant, like he was embarrassed to mention it.

"I, uh, I had to put my mother in an assisted living facility last month. My—my dad has long passed, and my brother moves around a lot as a roughneck. So I'm the only one. The only one here to really help her. It's a lot of paperwork and legal stuff I don't understand."

Unlike the Bobby LaPray who had angrily run me up one side and down the other not two minutes ago, this Bobby LaPray was different. When he talked, he looked defeated. He looked scared. And somehow, he looked small.

Letting his words sink in, a few seconds later I responded gently, "I'm sorry. I can't imagine what that's like."

He nodded slightly with pressed lips.

"But what I can tell you is"—I made sure to catch his eye—"you're a good son."

Immediately, Bobby LaPray threw his face down to keep me from seeing it. His huge shoulders shook. And like ice melting off a rock, big Bobby LaPray began to cry. I quickly told the court reporter to go off the record for a break.

"It's okay," I reassured him. "I'm just going to sit here with you."

Through tears, Bobby LaPray poured out all his fears over his mother's health. He told me about the intimidating letters threatening to foreclose his mother's house that he'd been receiving from none other than…lawyers. He shared how the banks and government were asking him for things he didn't understand. He felt helpless. He wished his father were still alive.

My heart broke for him. He was living in a world I knew nothing about. I thought of Evan.

Bobby LaPray had been holding the weight of it all by himself. For twenty minutes, we sat there as he let it all out. With his attorney's permission, I asked for Bobby LaPray's email address. Sitting there, I cc'd him on an email from my phone to a local colleague who handled elder law and estate planning. She replied minutes later, happily agreeing to set up a meeting with Bobby LaPray the next Monday.

"Thank you," he told me.

"Absolutely," I said. "You good?" I asked.

He took a big sniff, wiped his nose with his sleeve, and sat up. "Yeah," he answered with a weak grin. "I'm ready."

And for the rest of the deposition, I spoke to the real Bobby LaPray. His answers were direct and forthcoming. His words were more lighthearted. He became more animated, even cracked a few jokes. He no longer looked like he was ready to launch me into oblivion.

"All done," I said finally. "That's all the questions I have. Thank you for your time."

As we all stood up, I walked toward the door and stuck out my hand. I braced for another painful death grip. Instead, at the last second, Bobby LaPray opened up his arms and bear-hugged me. All I could do was smile and say, "Be good." I didn't look, but I'm fairly sure my feet weren't touching the ground.

### The Person You See

I've had countless interactions like that one throughout my life. Sometimes the other person is the Bobby LaPray. Other times, I'm the Bobby LaPray. But why does it happen? How is it that by dropping the idea of winning an argument, you get more of what you want? What is it about connecting to the other person that gives you the high ground? And how can you tap into that strength in your own communication?

It's easy to believe that communication should be cut-and-dried. A world where you say, "You're wrong," and the other person immediately replies, "Why yes, yes, I most certainly am." A place where, when someone says, "I'm fine," the only possible interpretation of the phrase is that they're totally and unequivocally fine. Where what you see on the outside is all there is to someone on the inside, and the boot always fits.

That's how you think it should be. That's what you want it to be. But that's not the way it is.

When you tell someone that they're wrong, they become more convinced that they're right. When someone says they're fine, they're often anything but. It's never as simple as matching stereotypes.

Given these problems, I want to go ahead and acknowledge a central theme of this book, and I hope you let this coin drop from your head to your heart:

> **The person you see isn't the person you're talking to.**

Think of a river and its undercurrent. On the surface, your eyes and ears can pick up a person's physical cues that shape your perception and judgments about them. But what's happening below the surface is where their real truth runs. For instance:

- The coworker you see is agitated and impatient. The coworker you're talking to didn't sleep well last night because he's worried about convincing his brother to go to rehab.

- The cashier you see is scattered and inattentive. The cashier you're talking to is worried about affording her kids' back-to-school supplies.

- The spouse you see is tense and short-fused. The spouse you're talking to had a horrible day at work starting with an email from a rude client.

Or, in my case, the mountain of a man I saw was aggressive and defensive. The Bobby LaPray I was talking to, on the other hand, felt alone and worried about his mother.

It's this other person you're talking to—the person you don't know—who you need to reach for when conflict starts to tear you apart. Understanding that there's more beneath the surface is one thing, but figuring out how to connect with their deeper self is another. How exactly are you supposed to reach them?

### The Struggle You Hear

When Bobby called my questions stupid, everything inside me wanted to prove him wrong. In that instant, the needs of the case took a back seat to my needs. My desire to be seen as right blinded me to any other options. I wanted to win. It's what I'm expected to do.

"Oh, you're an attorney? You must win a lot of arguments." I hear it all the time. It's also not true. Thanks to the countless books out there claiming to teach you how to win every argument, that's all anyone thinks you're supposed to do. Win.

So let me tell you now. If that's why you're reading this book, go ahead and return it. The sales pitch of winning an argument is overused and overpromised. That's not this book, and I'll tell you why.

For one, you can win an argument and still be wrong. And second, even if you win, you still come up empty-handed.

**Winning an argument is a losing game.**

Winning means that you've likely lost something far more valuable—their trust, their respect, or worse, the connection. The only reward you've won is their contempt. And for what? The argument ends. The conversation is over. You won, congratulations. Now what do you got?

The same unresolved issue at the cost of hurt feelings and awkward silence. Most likely, you still have to find a way to communicate with this person. You still have to live with them, to work with them. Depending on what you said, you may now be the one who owes an apology. Any feeling of pride is short-lived compared to the lasting damage to the relationship.

Trial attorneys don't even win arguments. They don't get to choose their clients' facts. They don't get to choose which law to follow. Everything has to pass through a filter of admissibility, then it's up to the judge or jury to apply the law to the evidence. It's more about giving the facts a voice than it is about winning an argument.

Competition in communication has convinced society that the world is divided into "right" and "wrong," "winners" and "losers." After a political debate, the first question someone asks the next morning is always, "Who won?"

But if we go back in time to the ancient Greeks, discourse had nothing to do with winning. A debate over opposing issues was a vehicle for pursuing truth. Exposing the weakness in another's argument was to strengthen and refine it, not dismiss it. Debates were known to last for days, even weeks, to give each person time to obtain perspective and explore divisive issues.

Today, the tendency is to do just the opposite. Rather than allowing disagreement to open you up to learning from another's perspective, you shut it down. Instead of refining your own understanding, you treat it as a threat. We run to social media like it's our own personal megaphone to voice just how much we disagree.

Be honest. How many times has a social media post disparaging your point of view ever changed your mind? And how many times has something you posted that criticized someone else's opinion ever changed theirs? Never. The world turns, the news cycle moves on, and the next day, no one cares. So, what then? What did you prove?

The fastest way to lose your peace of mind is to give someone a piece of yours. Beating out someone in an argument may feed your ego, but it'll still leave you hungry. Rarely, if ever, does winning in communication lead to better things in your life.

That's why I care enough about you to tell you the truth:

> **Never win an argument.**

Whether it's an argument, a heated discussion, or slight friction in conversation, your goal isn't to "win." It's to **unravel**. Start at the loose ends until you understand the heart of the matter. There you'll find the knot. This is a book of knots.

The hard stuff in social relationships that, admit it, you'd rather skip over. Untying crossed wires takes time, takes emotion, takes effort. That's what conflict in communication represents: a struggle.

An argument is a window into another person's struggle. In every difficult conversation, there's a moment when someone—whether it's you or the other person—hits a snag. Maybe you don't understand what they're trying to say. Maybe you're in a bad mood. Maybe you disagree. It's not the clash of opinions; it's the clash of worlds, of the very way you see things.

Behind every harsh and uncut word, there's a backstory, a why. And if you can find the discipline to get to that, if you can peel back the layers of the argument to discern the struggle, the fear, or the hope hiding underneath, that's where real communication begins.

Because at the end of the day, it's not about the argument. It's about seeing through the keyhole into another person's world and realizing that maybe, just maybe, the win you thought you wanted isn't what you needed after all.

### The Challenge to Accept

Most people understand that success comes from seeing failure not as a setback, but as a stepping stone. Embracing failure is part of the process. You learn from your mistakes to grow stronger.

Failures to communicate, as in disagreements and arguments, do the same thing. They lead to success because they reveal areas of improvement, offering insights into how you can enrich your interactions. The bigger the conversation, the bigger the need to handle conflict effectively.

When done right, conflict isn't a fight. It's an opportunity. It's a catalyst for real, meaningful connection, if you're willing to see it.

What life experiences have shaped how you see conflict? When you were a kid, defiantly shouting "No!" or bombarding adults with "Why?" was your way of figuring things out. Cause and effect. As a teenager, those simple childhood reactions turned into more complicated questions about finding your place and your identity apart from your family. The clothes you wore, the music you listened to, even the clique you hung around, were statements of who you wanted to be.

Stepping into adulthood, disagreements became less about asserting individuality and more about coexisting with other people. Your conversations turned to topics like children, career paths, and mortgages. Or in my case, what vacuum to buy and whether that piece of furniture I found in my parents' garage still had "good bones."

As an adult, the stakes change. Your responsibilities grow as you have to think collectively, now responsible for people other than yourself, such as aging parents or your own children. You take interest in broader issues like politics, news, and global affairs. Despite your age, things may feel even more uncertain.

When that happens, you tend to fall back to what you know—your lived experiences and the behaviors modeled for you growing up.

Ask yourself: How did watching arguments in my childhood influence the way I argue now?

If yelling and aggression were the go-to methods for conflict in your home growing up, you might find yourself thinking that's just how things are done, even if you know it's not the best way to get your point across. On the flip side, if you came from a place where everyone tiptoed around disagreements to save face or avoided conversations out of fear of what the neighbors might think, diving headfirst into arguments might make you feel uncomfortable.

Take this one time I stayed over at a friend's house during the summer as a kid. His parents got into a massive shouting match right in front of us—doors slamming, the works. I remember being absolutely mortified. I grew up with parents who kept their arguments private, either hashing things out in their room or waiting until we were asleep. So, seeing his parents go at it, I was positive that a divorce was unfolding before my eyes. But my friend? He didn't even blink. To him, it was just a typical Tuesday night.

Looking back, maybe you're not thrilled with how conflict was handled around you. Maybe you have bad memories of seeing arguments bring out the worst in the people you loved. Maybe you've caught yourself echoing their words or mirroring their actions—even in the little things, like how you move your hands or the tone of your voice. You've gotten to a point in your life where you're beginning to realize that what you observed wasn't that healthy. And you can't help but wonder, would things have gone easier for you in your own life if you'd seen better ways to deal with conflict?

If that's you, then I'm asking you to take on the challenge and break the cycle.

Stop seeing arguments as something to win but as an opportunity to understand the person behind the words. Stop hearing only what's said and start hearing what's felt. Build the discipline to connect to the person in front of you. Embrace the failures to communicate and learn from them. Reach success by using each misstep as a stepping-stone, and make room for more positive and real in your life—like a bear hug from a man who until recently wanted to shot-put you.

Now, it's highly likely that the themes in the pages ahead won't be anything new to you. You know you should speak with confidence and control your emotions. You know you should avoid getting defensive and stand up for yourself. The question you have is "Yes, but what does that look like?"

Well, it starts with what you say next.

> ### Chapter Summary
> 
> The person you see isn't the person you're talking to. Every person has a surface and a depth. Often, the emotions you hear in someone's voice are not bids for disagreement but bids for connection.
> 
> Don't buy into the lie that you need to win an argument. When you seek to win, you tend to lose much more, like the other person's trust or respect. Instead, view arguments as a window into another person's struggle.
> 
> Conflict can be a catalyst for positive changes in your life. To harness it, you have to be willing to connect with the person opposite you. Turning your conflicts into connections paves the way for a more fulfilling, meaningful life. All you need is in what you say next.
