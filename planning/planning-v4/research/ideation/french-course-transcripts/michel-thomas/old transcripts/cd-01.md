French with Michel Thomas. Copyright 2000.

**[Michel Thomas]**
You're about to experience a new and different approach to learning, and to language learning, that will give you the practical and functional use within 10 to 12 hours of learning time. All this is achieved without memorizing - which means there's never anything to memorize - without learning by rote, without drill, without textbooks, without taking notes, and without homework. Without any mental homework.

Before starting, I have to set up two ground rules. Two very important ground rules.

First, it is very important for you to be relaxed, to take off, to leave off any form of tension, any form of anxiety that is usually associated with learning, and traditionally also particularly with language learning. Any form of anxiety, any form of tension inhibits true and effective learning.

The first ground rule is for you never to worry about remembering, and therefore never to try to remember. Because this is a method where the responsibility for your remembering is in the teaching and not with you. Not with the learner. And this is a method where the responsibility for attention is in the teaching and not with the learner.

Therefore, there's no homework, not even any mental homework. It's very important not to review, even mentally, what you've learned. Let it be absorbed and internalized to become knowledge. And what you know, you will not forget.

The second ground rule is that in the course I'm using two students as a teaching device in order to create a learning situation for three. You'll become the third in the group, and very quickly you will associate with the two on the tapes. You will become part of it.

It's very important, therefore, that after I introduce a concept, I will follow up in a practical way and show you how to formulate and to express thoughts in sentences. First those will be short sentences, then more and more complex and longer sentences.

Whenever I say "How do you say it?" at that point it's very important - I repeat, very important - for you to use the pause button on the machine, which gives you time to think it out, to think it through, and to respond out loud. After you respond, you release the pause button. You will then get the response from one of the two students. And after that, I will repeat it so that the last impression is always what you get from me.

This is how you will experience a constant sense of progression, a constant sense of learning that you will find exciting, stimulating, and self-rewarding.

Thank you.

Now, a few words about the French language. You'll get acquainted with a language that is not entirely foreign, alien to English, but there is a broad common basis of familiarity between English and French, so much so that over 60% "de votre vocabulaire anglais" - of your English vocabulary - comes from French. "D'origine française" - of French origin.

Because English is actually a mixed language, mixed between Anglo-Saxon, Germanic Anglo-Saxon, and French. The French that was brought over to the British Isles with the Norman invasion. The Normans spoke French, and did so for a few hundred years. So for a few hundred years, England was bilingual, with Anglo-Saxon and French spoken.

"Pratiquement" - practically - two out of three or four words in English come from French, are "d'origine française" - of French origin.

When Alexandre Dumas, the French author, once decided to learn English, and when for the first time he looked at an English book, he noticed all those "similarités" - all those similarities between English and French. And he finally exclaimed, "But English is all French, badly pronounced." And he had a point, because with most words, it's just a question "d'accent" - a question of accent. Just a "différence in the prononciation" - a difference in the pronunciation.

So "pour commencer" - to start, to commence - I'm going to give you a few keys to show you how you can "retransformer" - retransform - "votre vocabulaire anglais" - your English vocabulary - back into French. So that within the next hour or so, you will have a starting "vocabulaire" - vocabulary - of between 2,000 and 3,000 words, which is not bad to begin with.

"Spécialement" - specially - "si vous considérez" - if you consider - how "limitée" - how limited - the "vocabulaire" is, which we use in our everyday language. "Le vocabulaire actif" - the active vocabulary - used in our everyday language, may "varier" - may vary - between 500 and 1,500 words. It's very small.

All words in English ending in -IBLE come from French. And in French, -IBLE is pronounced "-ible". Like "possible" would be "possible". Same spelling, same meaning. "Possible".

The letter I is pronounced E. And -ABLE is pronounced "-able" because the letter A is pronounced A. "Table" is "table". "Comfortable" is "comfortable".

So how would you say "possible" in French?

**[Female Student]**
"Possible."

**[Michel Thomas]**
"Possible." Right. And "table"?

**[Male Student]**
"Table."

**[Female Student]**
"Table."

**[Michel Thomas]**
And "comfortable"?

**[Male Student]**
"Comfortable."

**[Female Student]**
"Comfortable."

## Basic Structure: C'est

You may have heard the expression, "C'est la vie."

**[Female Student]**
"C'est la vie?"

**[Michel Thomas]**
Yes. Do you know what it means?

**[Female Student]**
That's life?

**[Michel Thomas]**
"That's life", right. So "c'est", spelled C-apostrophe-E-S-T, means "it is" or "that is". "C'est".

And "la vie" means "life", "the life".

If you want to say "It is possible," would be?

**[Female Student]**
"C'est possible."

**[Michel Thomas]**
Right. "C'est possible". "It is comfortable"?

**[Male Student]**
"C'est comfortable."

**[Michel Thomas]**
"C'est comfortable." Right.

## Adding "Very" - Très

The word for "good" is "bon". Like bon-bon is goody-goody. "It is good" would be?

**[Female Student]**
"C'est bon."

**[Michel Thomas]**
"C'est bon". If you want to make it "very good", would be "très bon". "Très" means "very". So "it is very good" would be?

**[Female Student]**
"C'est très bon."

**[Michel Thomas]**
"C'est très bon". And "it is very comfortable"?

**[Male Student]**
"C'est très comfortable."

**[Michel Thomas]**
Right. "C'est très comfortable". "Probable" would be?

**[Female Student]**
"C'est probable."

**[Michel Thomas]**
Right, "C'est probable". And "it is acceptable"?

**[Male Student]**
"C'est acceptable."

## For Me/For You - Pour

"For me" is "pour moi". "Pour moi". "Pour" means "for". P-O-U-R. "Pour moi", "for me". So "it is for me" would be?

**[Female Student]**
"C'est pour moi."

**[Michel Thomas]**
"C'est pour moi". Yes. And "for you" would be "pour vous". "Vous" spelled V-O-U-S. "It is for you" would be?

**[Male Student]**
"C'est pour vous."

**[Michel Thomas]**
"C'est pour vous". "It is very comfortable for me"?

**[Male Student]**
"C'est très comfortable pour moi."

## Negation - Ce n'est pas

"It is not" is "ce n'est pas". "Ce n'est pas" - it starts like a snake. "Ce n'est pas", "it is not". The word for "not" by itself is "pas". Spelled P-A-S.

If you want to say, "Not for me, thank you," would be "Pas pour moi, merci." "Merci" is "thanks."

So again, "it is"?

**[Male Student]**
"C'est."

**[Michel Thomas]**
"C'est". "It is not"?

**[Male Student]**
"Ce n'est pas."

**[Michel Thomas]**
"Ce n'est pas". Right. "It is not for me"?

**[Male Student]**
"Ce n'est pas pour moi."

**[Michel Thomas]**
"Ce n'est pas pour moi". Yes. But just, "Not for me, thanks"?

**[Male Student]**
"Pas pour moi, merci."

**[Michel Thomas]**
Right. "Pas pour moi, merci". "It is not very comfortable for me"?

**[Female Student]**
"Ce n'est pas très confortable pour moi."

**[Michel Thomas]**
Right. "Ce n'est pas très confortable pour moi."

**[Michel Thomas]**
You may have heard the expression, "Comme ci, comme ça." Have you ever?

**[Female Student]**
Yes.

**[Michel Thomas]**
Yes. Because it's used so much. "Comme ci, comme ça" means actually, so-so. Literally, "comme ci, comme ça" means "comme ci" - "like this", like this here; "comme ça" - "like that".

The "comme ça" part, the second part of "comme ci, comme ça", "comme ça", is used very much in French for "like that" or "that way".

If you want to say, "It is like that," would be?

**[Female Student]**
"C'est ça."

**[Michel Thomas]**
"It is like that." "It is?" Again, "it is"?

**[Female Student]**
"C'est."

**[Michel Thomas]**
Right. And "like that" is? I don't want you to guess. Think it out, but don't guess. So, "like this, like that" is "comme..."

**[Female Student]**
"Comme ci."

**[Michel Thomas]**
And?

**[Female Student]**
"Comme ça."

**[Michel Thomas]**
"Comme ça." The "comme ça" part means "like that" or "that way."

So if you want to say, "It is like that," would be?

**[Female Student]**
"C'est comme ça."

**[Michel Thomas]**
"C'est comme ça." Right. "It is not like that," would be?

**[Male Student]**
"Ce n'est pas comme ça."

**[Michel Thomas]**
Right. "Ce n'est pas comme ça."

How to say, "It is not possible for me that way"?

**[Female Student]**
"Ce n'est pas possible pour moi comme ça."

**[Michel Thomas]**
Right. "Ce n'est pas possible pour moi comme ça."

## Apologies - Je regrette

If you want to say, "I'm sorry," you may want to say it sometimes, is "je regrette". "Je regrette". I regret. "Je" means "I". It's a soft "je". "Je regrette." I regret, or I'm sorry. How would you say it?

**[Male Student]**
"Je regrette."

**[Female Student]**
"Je regrette."

**[Michel Thomas]**
"Je regrette." Right. "Je regrette."

So, "je regrette" - I'm sorry. I regret. Usually followed by "but". Yes. I'm sorry, but. "Je regrette, mais." "Mais" means "but". "Je regrette, mais."

So how do you say, "I'm sorry, but it is not very comfortable for me that way." I'm sorry, but?

**[Female Student]**
"Je regrette, mais ce n'est pas très comfortable pour moi comme ça."

**[Michel Thomas]**
Right. "Je regrette, mais" - I'm sorry but - "ce n'est pas" - it is not - "très comfortable" - very comfortable - "pour moi" - for me - "comme ça" - like that or that way.

So how do you say, "I'm sorry, but it is not acceptable for me that way?"

**[Male Student]**
"Je regrette, mais ce n'est pas acceptable pour moi comme ça."

**[Michel Thomas]**
Right. "Je regrette, mais" - I'm sorry but - "ce n'est pas" - it is not - "acceptable" - acceptable - "pour moi" - for me - "comme ça" - like that.

## More -ABLE Words

How would you say "remarkable"? "It is very remarkable."

**[Male Student]**
"Remarquable."

**[Michel Thomas]**
Right. "It is very remarkable"?

**[Male Student]**
"C'est très remarquable."

**[Michel Thomas]**
Right. "C'est très remarquable." "Considerable"?

**[Female Student]**
"Considerable."

**[Michel Thomas]**
Right. "Considerable."

Words in English ending in -ENT and -ANT come from French. They're the same. Same spelling, same meaning. Pronounced "-ung". -ENT and -ANT is pronounced "-ung". Like "different" would be?

**[Female Student]**
"Différent."

**[Michel Thomas]**
"Différent." Yes. "Important" would be?

**[Male Student]**
"Important."

**[Female Student]**
"Important."

**[Michel Thomas]**
"Important." Yes. The I-N and I-M is pronounced "-ung". "Important." Yes. And the "accent", the "accent", the stress, is always softly at the end of a word in French. Always put it at the end. It may often make the difference between being understood or not being understood, depending on putting the accent at the end. The stress at the end of a word.

So, "it is not very different that way" would be?

**[Female Student]**
"Ce n'est pas très différent comme ça."

**[Michel Thomas]**
Right. "Ce n'est pas très différent comme ça."

"But it is very important for me"?

**[Male Student]**
"Mais c'est très important pour moi."

**[Michel Thomas]**
Right. "Mais" - but - "c'est très" - it is very - "important" - important - "pour moi."

"Très" is spelled T-R-É-S. The "S" at the end of a word may be pushed over to the following word if the following word starts with a vowel, and it takes on the sound of a "Z." For instance, "very important" can be "très important." But the "S" belongs, is hooked onto "important", to the vowel. In slow motion it is "très important." So it's not "très." But "très important." "C'est très important."

**[Male Student]**
"Très important."

**[Michel Thomas]**
If you cut, then there's no push. If you cut off the "très" you say, "C'est très - important." Or, "C'est très important."

"Evident" would be?

**[Male Student]**
"Évident."

**[Michel Thomas]**
"Évident." Yes. "Recent" would be?

**[Female Student]**
"Récent."

**[Michel Thomas]**
"Récent." "Constant"?

**[Female Student]**
"Constant."

**[Michel Thomas]**
"Constant." Yes.

Words in English ending in -ARY, everything in -ARY, like "necessary", "contrary", "military", everything -ARY. -ARY goes up into the air. So instead of in the spelling A-R-Y, it's spelled A-I-R-E. So "necessary" would be?

**[Male Student]**
"Nécessaire."

**[Michel Thomas]**
"Nécessaire." So, "it is not necessary for me"?

**[Male Student]**
"Ce n'est pas nécessaire pour moi."

**[Michel Thomas]**
Right. "Ce n'est pas nécessaire pour moi."

"Contrary"?

**[Female Student]**
"Contraire."

**[Michel Thomas]**
"Contraire." Yes. You may hear French people say, "Au contraire." They like to say that. "Au contraire." Meaning, "on the contrary."

"Military"?

**[Male Student]**
"Militaire."

**[Michel Thomas]**
"Militaire." And "vocabulary"?

**[Female Student]**
"Vocabulaire."

**[Michel Thomas]**
Right. "Vocabulaire."

**[Male Student]**
Should you try and visualize the word?

**[Michel Thomas]**
Yes. Sure. I'm giving you the spelling, so visualize the spelling. Mentally. You're not writing it down.

## "I Would Like" - Je voudrais

"I would like" is "je voudrais." "Je voudrais." I would like. "Je voudrais." "Voudrais" is spelled in one word V-O-U-D-R-A-I-S. "Je voudrais." I would like.

So again, "I would like"?

**[Male Student]**
"Je voudrais."

**[Female Student]**
"Je voudrais."

## Verbs: To Speak, To Come, To Eat

"To speak" is "parler". You may have heard the expression, "Parlez-vous français," or whatever. "Parler", to speak, spelled P-A-R-L-E-R. "Parler." And "to speak French" would be "parler français."

So, "I would like to speak French" would be?

**[Female Student]**
"Je voudrais parler français."

**[Michel Thomas]**
Right. "Je voudrais parler français."

"With you." "With" is "avec". Spelled A-V-E-C. "With you" would be "avec vous." "With me" would be "avec moi."

So "I would like to speak French with you"?

**[Male Student]**
"Je voudrais parler français avec vous."

**[Michel Thomas]**
Right. "Je voudrais parler français avec vous."

"Will you, will you please" is "voulez-vous." "Voulez-vous." Like, "will you." "Voulez-vous." Will you. Actually, "voulez-vous" has two meanings. It means, "Will you, will you please." It also means, "Do you want." But let's use it now as "will you, will you please." "Voulez-vous."

"Will you speak French with me," would be?

**[Male Student]**
"Voulez-vous parler français avec moi?"

**[Female Student]**
"Voulez-vous parler français avec moi?"

**[Michel Thomas]**

**[Michel Thomas]**
"Voulez-vous manger?" Always put the stress at the end. "Voulez-vous manger?"

So again, "to come" is? Like, to come, what you find on the wood.

**[Female Student]**
"Voulez-vous venir avec moi?"

**[Michel Thomas]**
"Voulez-vous venir avec moi?" Yes.

How would you say, "Will you come eat with me?"

**[Male Student]**
"Voulez-vous venir manger avec moi?"

**[Michel Thomas]**
Right. I want you to think it out, step by step, slowly. "Voulez-vous venir manger avec moi."

"To go" is "aller." The English word "alley" comes from it. It's a passageway where you "alley" through. "Aller", "to go."

Again, "to come" is?

**[Male Student]**
"Venir."

**[Michel Thomas]**
"Venir." And "to go" is?

**[Male Student]**
"Aller."

**[Michel Thomas]**
"Aller." So, how would you say, "Will you go eat with me?"

**[Male Student]**
"Où."

**[Michel Thomas]**

Right. So "voulez-vous" means "will you", "voulez-vous" also means "do you want." So again, "where do you want to go" would be?

**[Female Student]**
"Où voulez-vous aller?"

**[Michel Thomas]**
Right. "Où voulez-vous aller?" "Where do you want to go?"

The word for "tonight," it's a beautiful word. Actually, two words. In French, you say "this evening," which is "ce soir." "Ce soir." "Ce soir," like in "soirée," "soir." "Ce soir," "this evening" or "tonight."

How would you say, "It is for tonight"?

**[Female Student]**
"C'est pour ce soir."

**[Michel Thomas]**
Right. "C'est pour ce soir."

So "where do you want to go eat tonight" would be?

**[Female Student]**
"Où voulez-vous aller manger ce soir?"

**[Michel Thomas]**
Right. "Où voulez-vous aller manger ce soir?"

"To have dinner" in French, you say "to dine". "Dîner." "Dîner" is "to dine" or "to have dinner." "Le dîner" means "the dinner," but "dîner" by itself means "to dine" or "to have dinner."

Like, "where do you want to have dinner tonight?"

**[Male Student]**
"Où voulez-vous dîner ce soir?"

**[Michel Thomas]**

The word for "something" is "quelque chose." "Quelque chose." "Chose", "la chose" means "the thing." "La chose." "La même chose" is "the same thing." And "quelque chose", "something."

Right. "Ce n'est pas logique" - it is not logical - "mais" - but - "c'est très pratique" - it is very practical - "comme ça" - that way.

If you want to talk about the political situation, in French you will say the situation, and then you will describe what kind of situation. So, the political situation would be the situation. What kind? "Politique".

So, how would you say "the political situation"?

**[Male Student]**

I'm thinking about, trying to remember, "passer", "passer" is to pass time.

**[Michel Thomas]**
But you're not supposed to try to remember.

**[Male Student]**
Okay. All right. It's just association. All right.

**[Michel Thomas]**
That's against the ground rule.

**[Male Student]**
Against the rules.

**[Michel Thomas]**
Against the ground rule. You're trying to hold onto it. Please don't.

**[Male Student]**
Okay.

**[Michel Thomas]**
[This reinforces the fundamental principle of the Michel Thomas method - students should not try to memorize or hold onto information, but let it be absorbed naturally through the teaching process.]
