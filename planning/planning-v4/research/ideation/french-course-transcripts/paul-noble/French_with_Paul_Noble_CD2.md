# French with Paul Noble CD2

[Paul Noble]
Now, you may have noticed that we've introduced quite a large number of terms early on. But again, as I sta- stated at the outset, you shouldn't worry or concern yourself particularly with remembering all of them. In fact, it's not a bad thing to forget, forget them at all. As you'll have noticed, I've already started reintroducing concepts that we intro- that we mentioned early on. And this will happen throughout the course. So again, always trying to remember and never letting yourself forget anything wouldn't be a good thing. If you're forgetting words, that's a good thing. They will come up and by the end of the course, you will know them and you will understand how to use them in French. As you mentioned earlier, "It is" in French is?

[Marion]
C'est.

[Paul Noble]
"It is not" in French is?

[Marion]
Ce n'est pas. Ce n'est pas.

[Paul Noble]
How would you say, "It's not romantic"?

[Marion]
Ce n'est pas romantique.

[Paul Noble]
"It's not exotic."

[Marion]
Ce n'est pas exotique.

[Paul Noble]
How would you say, "I would like to know if it's not exotic?"

[Marion]
Je voudrais savoir si ce n'est pas exotique.

[Paul Noble]
The word for "why" in French is?

[Marion]
Pourquoi. Pourquoi.

[Paul Noble]
Which literally means, "for what." So in English you could say, "Why do I have to do this?" But you might also say, "For what reason do I have to do it?" And in French, they'll always say, "For what? For, for what do I have to go there? For what reason do I have to do it?" So, "pourquoi" is "for what." With that in mind, how would you say, "I would like to know why it's not romantic?"

[Marion]
Je voudrais savoir pourquoi ce n'est pas romantique.

[Paul Noble]
How would you say, "I would like to know why you have prepared the dinner"?

[Marion]
Je voudrais savoir pourquoi vous avez préparé le dîner.

[Paul Noble]
So, what is "you have" in French, "you have"?

[Marion]
Vous avez.

[Paul Noble]
How would you say, "You have a room, a chamber, for two people, for two persons, for two nights"? So you have a room for two people for two nights.

[Marion]
Vous avez une chambre pour deux personnes pour deux nuits.

[Paul Noble]
Now, you can actually turn that into a question in French by simply raising your voice at the end of the question. So you'll say some- instead of saying, "You have a room for two people for two nights?" you'll say, "You have a room for two people for two nights?" That's a very typical way to ask a question in French. We do it, we do it in English as well, but nowhere near as much as the French do. And often in English, we do it to- to express disbelief or incredulity, and say something like, "You have a room for two people for two nights?" It's, it's perhaps suggesting something else in English. But in French, it's just a very typical way to ask a question without any extra meaning. So again, let's practice that one more time. How would you say as a statement, "You have a room for two people for two nights?"

[Marion]
Vous avez une chambre pour deux personnes pour deux nuits.

[Paul Noble]
Now, let's try turning that into a question simply by saying it again, but raising your voice at the end, say, and saying, "You have a room for two people for two nights?"

[Marion]
Vous avez une chambre pour deux personnes pour deux nuits?

[Paul Noble]
It's a very typical way to do it in French and quite easy. Because if you know how to make the statement, you can make the question. And again, it's very, very typical way that the French actually speak. Let's, um, let's give an answer to that question and say, "Yes, I have a room for two persons."

[Marion]
Oui, j'ai une chambre pour deux personnes.

[Paul Noble]
So the person telling you that they have a room for two people may also mention some of the other things it has. For instance, they may mention it has a shower. And the word for "shower" in French is?

[Marion]
Douche.

[Marion]
Douche.

[Paul Noble]
To say, "With a shower," or, "With shower," the French will say?

[Marion]
Avec douche.

[Marion]
Avec douche.

[Paul Noble]
So how would you say, "Yes, I have a room for two people with shower"?

[Marion]
Oui, j'ai une chambre pour deux personnes avec douche.

[Paul Noble]
So again, what is "you have," "you have" in French?

[Marion]
Vous avez.

[Paul Noble]
To say, "You have not," or, "You don't have," which is the same in French, you would say?

[Marion]
Vous n'avez pas.

[Marion]
Vous n'avez pas.

[Paul Noble]
So we have the positive one, which is "you have," which is?

[Marion]
Vous avez.

[Paul Noble]
And there are a few things that are going on there to make it negative in French. The most important is the final word, the final word, which is?

[Marion]
Pas.

[Paul Noble]
And that means "not" in French. That means "not." Um, but you might also have heard there's a sort of an "N" sound in there, an "N." So if we have the whole thing again, "you have not" is?

[Marion]
Vous n'avez pas.

[Paul Noble]
There's a sound of an "N" early on. And all that is, is that is a negative warning. It's an "N" for a negative warning saying something negative's coming up. Because of course, "you have not," is a negative sentence. It's not positive like "you have." So let's go back to "you have" again, which is?

[Marion]
Vous avez.

[Paul Noble]
But "you don't have" is?

[Marion]
Vous n'avez pas.

[Paul Noble]
So we have the "not" on the end for the "you do not have." But you'll notice before that "avez," there's a little "N" sound and "vous avez" becomes "vous n'avez", "vous n'avez." And then for the whole thing, "you have not," we have?

[Marion]
Vous n'avez pas.

[Paul Noble]
Okay. So how would you say, "You have not reserved a room?"

[Marion]
Vous n'avez pas réservé une chambre.

[Paul Noble]
And how would you say, "I would like to know why you haven't reserved a room?"

[Marion]
Je voudrais savoir pourquoi vous n'avez pas réservé une chambre.

[Paul Noble]
How would you say, "I would like to know why you haven't prepared the dinner. I'm hungry." Let's go back and start early on with, "I would like to know why."

[Marion]
Je voudrais savoir pourquoi.

[Paul Noble]
"You have not prepared the dinner."

[Marion]
Vous n'avez pas préparé le dîner.

[Paul Noble]
And then, "I'm hungry." Literally, "I have hunger."

[Marion]
J'ai faim.

[Paul Noble]
The word for "and" in French, "and", is?

[Marion]
Et.

[Marion]
Et.

[Paul Noble]
So how would you say, "I've prepared the dinner, and I would like to know why you haven't prepared the coffee"? Let's go back to the beginning. "I have prepared the dinner."

[Marion]
J'ai préparé le dîner.

[Paul Noble]
"And."

[Marion]
Et.

[Paul Noble]
"I would like to know why."

[Marion]
Je voudrais savoir pourquoi.

[Paul Noble]
"You haven't prepared the coffee."

[Marion]
Vous n'avez pas préparé le café.

[Paul Noble]
Now, let's put the whole thing together. "I've prepared the dinner, and I would like to know why you haven't prepared the coffee."

[Marion]
J'ai préparé le dîner et je voudrais savoir pourquoi vous n'avez pas préparé le café.

[Paul Noble]
Now again, a lot of new vocabulary, a lot of new concepts have been introduced here. On the one hand, I don't want you to actively try and remember, and I'm, I'd prefer it if you actually let yourself forget. However, if you feel you're struggling at all at this point or a little bit confused, feel free to go back a track or two and re-listen because you'll find the second time round, it will be far easier.

[Paul Noble]
So again, what is "you have"?

[Marion]
Vous avez.

[Paul Noble]
And "you have not"?

[Marion]
Vous n'avez pas.

[Paul Noble]
What is "I have"?

[Marion]
J'ai.

[Paul Noble]
"I have not" works in a similar way. The word for "not" is of course?

[Marion]
Pas.

[Paul Noble]
And "I have not" is?

[Marion]
Je n'ai pas.

[Paul Noble]
So again, let's go back to just "I have," which is?

[Marion]
J'ai.

[Paul Noble]
And "I have not"?

[Marion]
Je n'ai pas.

[Paul Noble]
So again, you have that "not" at the end. The "pas." And that comes at the end, but you really, in correct French, you do need to have a negative warning to tell the person a "not" is coming. So "I have" is?

[Marion]
J'ai.

[Paul Noble]
And what you'll do is that, that "A" sound, you'll put a "pas" afterwards, but you'll put a negative warning sound before, which is just the sound of an "N." So what you end up with is a sandwich. The "pas" is one slice of bread and the "ne", the "N" sound is another. And you'll wrap it around that word. You have, "I have," which is?

[Marion]
J'ai.

[Paul Noble]
Then you'll put a "ne" at the beginning of the "A" and a "pas" afterwards, which is then?

[Marion]
Je n'ai pas.

[Paul Noble]
So again, how would you say, "I have not"?

[Marion]
Je n'ai pas.

[Paul Noble]
"I have not visited the Louvre."

[Marion]
Je n'ai pas visité le Louvre.

[Paul Noble]
"I haven't invited Paul to the cinema."

[Marion]
Je n'ai pas invité Paul au cinéma.

[Paul Noble]
Again, it's important to remember that that "I-N" in French is pronounced in that sulky teenager kind of way as a-

[Marion]
Uh.

[Paul Noble]
Yeah, simply think, "Uh, I hate you," and the sort of sound you might be familiar with. Um, and again, "to the cinema" was?

[Marion]
Au cinéma.

[Paul Noble]
So that, that "to the" just has a sort of "O" sound to it. So "to the cinema"?

[Marion]
Au cinéma.

[Paul Noble]
All right. How would you say, "I haven't reserved a table for dinner"? Or as the French would say, "I haven't reserved a table for the dinner."

[Marion]
Je n'ai pas réservé une table pour le dîner.

[Paul Noble]
And again, remember that "dinner" in French is pronounced?

[Marion]
Le dîner.

[Paul Noble]
How would you say, "I haven't decorated the house"?

[Marion]
Je n'ai pas décoré la maison.

[Paul Noble]
Now, remember, to make something in the past tense in French, say from an- a, a word ending in, in -ation, the -ation group of words we've looked at, you'll simply cut off the -ation and in its place add a cafe "E." So "decoration" will then become "decorated." So you cut off the -ation from decoration and add a cafe "E," and so "decorated" will be?

[Marion]
Décoré.

[Paul Noble]
And so, "I haven't decorated the house" would be?

[Marion]
Je n'ai pas décoré la maison.

[Paul Noble]
The word for, to say, "I'm sorry" in French, there are various ways, but one of the most common ways is to say, "I regret," which in French is?

[Marion]
Je regrette.

[Marion]
Je regrette.

[Paul Noble]
The word for "but" as we mentioned earlier, is?

[Marion]
Mais.

[Paul Noble]
So how would you say, "I'm sorry, but."

[Marion]
Je regrette, mais.

[Paul Noble]
"I'm sorry, but I haven't reserved a table for dinner."

[Marion]
Je regrette, mais je n'ai pas réservé une table pour le diner.

[Paul Noble]
How about, "I'm sorry, but I didn't invite Paul to the cinema"?

[Marion]
Je regrette, mais je n'ai pas invité Paul au cinéma.

[Paul Noble]
Again, make sure to pronounce the "I-N" on invitation or in- "invited" in French as a sort of a "uh" sound. So "invited" in French is of course?

[Marion]
Invité.

[Paul Noble]
How would you say, "I'm sorry, but I haven't prepared the coffee"?

[Marion]
Je regrette, mais je n'ai pas préparé le café.

[Paul Noble]
How about, "I've prepared dinner for you. Have you prepared coffee for me?" Try the first part, "I've prepared dinner for you."

[Marion]
J'ai préparé le dîner pour vous.

[Paul Noble]
And now the last bit. "Have you prepared the coffee for me?"

[Marion]
Avez-vous préparé le café pour moi?

[Paul Noble]
Finally, "I'm sorry, but I haven't prepared the coffee for you."

[Marion]
Je regrette, mais je n'ai pas préparé le café pour vous.

[Paul Noble]
Again, how would you say, "I would like"?

[Marion]
Je voudrais.

[Paul Noble]
How about, "I would like to prepare the dinner."

[Marion]
Je voudrais préparer le dîner.

[Paul Noble]
To say in French, to say, "to prepare it," you will say?

[Marion]
Le préparer.

[Marion]
Le préparer.

[Paul Noble]
So how would you say, "I would like to prepare it?"

[Marion]
Je voudrais le préparer.

[Paul Noble]
"I can" in French, "I can" is?

[Marion]
Je peux.

[Marion]
Je peux.

[Paul Noble]
So how would you say, "I can prepare it"?

[Marion]
Je peux le préparer.

[Paul Noble]
How would you say, "I can prepare the dinner"?

[Marion]
Je peux préparer le dîner.

[Paul Noble]
So as you can see, "the dinner" comes where it's been going the whole time so far as we've been learning. But when we say, "to prepare it," well, it's in a slightly different position than "the dinner" is. So again, "I can prepare the dinner."

[Marion]
Je peux préparer le dîner.

[Paul Noble]
But, "to prepare it" is?

[Marion]
Le préparer.

[Paul Noble]
So, "I can prepare it."

[Marion]
Je peux le préparer.

[Paul Noble]
So again, what is "I can"?

[Marion]
Je peux.

[Paul Noble]
"He can," very logically, will be?

[Marion]
Il peut.

[Paul Noble]
And so, "she can" will be?

[Marion]
Elle peut.

[Paul Noble]
"She can prepare it."

[Marion]
Elle peut le préparer.

[Paul Noble]
"To eat" in French, "to eat" is?

[Marion]
Manger.

[Marion]
Manger.

[Paul Noble]
So how would you say, "She can eat it"?

[Marion]
Elle peut le manger.

[Paul Noble]
Remember, "to eat" is?

[Marion]
Manger.

[Paul Noble]
But of course, "to eat it" will be?

[Marion]
Le manger.

[Paul Noble]
So again, "She can eat it."

[Marion]
Elle peut le manger.

[Paul Noble]
"She can prepare it."

[Marion]
Elle peut le préparer.

[Paul Noble]
"He can prepare it."

[Marion]
Il peut le préparer.

[Paul Noble]
"I can prepare it."

[Marion]
Je peux le préparer.

[Paul Noble]
And again, how would you say, "I can"?

[Marion]
Je peux.

[Paul Noble]
"He can."

[Marion]
Il peut.

[Paul Noble]
"She can."

[Marion]
Elle peut.

[Paul Noble]
"She can prepare it."

[Marion]
Elle peut le préparer.

[Paul Noble]
"She can prepare the dinner."

[Marion]
Elle peut préparer le dîner.

[Paul Noble]
The word meaning "to do" in French, "to do" is?

[Marion]
Faire.

[Paul Noble]
So how would you say, "She can do it"?

[Marion]
Elle peut le faire.

[Paul Noble]
"Today" in French, "today" is?

[Marion]
Aujourd'hui.

[Marion]
Aujourd'hui.

[Paul Noble]
"She can do it today."

[Marion]
Elle peut le faire aujourd'hui.

[Paul Noble]
Good. If "she can" is-

[Marion]
Elle peut.

[Paul Noble]
How do you think sh- you would say, "She cannot"?

[Marion]
Elle ne peut pas.

[Paul Noble]
So, "She cannot do it today."

[Marion]
Elle ne peut pas le faire aujourd'hui.

[Paul Noble]
"I cannot do it today."

[Marion]
Je ne peux pas le faire aujourd'hui.

[Paul Noble]
"He cannot do it today."

[Marion]
Il ne peut pas le faire aujourd'hui.

[Paul Noble]
"You can" in French is-

[Marion]
Vous pouvez.

[Marion]
Vous pouvez.

[Paul Noble]
How would you say, "you can do it"?

[Marion]
Vous pouvez le faire.

[Paul Noble]
"You can do it today."

[Marion]
Vous pouvez le faire aujourd'hui.

[Paul Noble]
Now, as I mentioned earlier, um, one of the ways you can ask a question in French is simply to raise your voice at the end. So, let's try that sentence again. "You can do it today."

[Marion]
Vous pouvez le faire aujourd'hui.

[Paul Noble]
In order to make that into a question and ask, "Can you do it today?" In French, perhaps the easiest way is simply to use a rising intonation at the end and raise your voice at the end of it and say, "You can do it today?" How would you say that?

[Marion]
Vous pouvez le faire aujourd'hui?

[Paul Noble]
It, that isn't the only way, however, to ask a question in French. It's certainly one of the easiest. But another way is to invert the sentence order. So, for instance, what is "you can," "You can"?

[Marion]
Vous pouvez.

[Paul Noble]
Now, you can also ask a question by simply changing around the order as we do in English from you can to can you. So, "you can" which is-

[Marion]
Vous pouvez.

[Paul Noble]
Will become-

[Marion]
Pouvez-vous?

[Paul Noble]
So, using that construction, how would you say, "Can you do it today?"

[Marion]
Pouvez-vous le faire aujourd'hui?

[Paul Noble]
"Can you eat it?"

[Marion]
Pouvez-vous le manger?

[Paul Noble]
Now try same sentence, "can you eat it?" but simply using the rising intonation. So, "You can eat it?"

[Marion]
Vous pouvez le manger?

[Paul Noble]
Finally, there is still another way to ask a question in French. Again, it's not important to remember all of these at the moment. You'll be able to remember by the time you finish the course, as there's going to be ample time to practice each of them. The other way to ask a question in French is to use, "Is it that?" "Is it that?" It sounds very formal to us, but to a French person, it's a very normal way to ask a question. So, "is it that" in French is?

[Marion]
Est-ce que.

[Marion]
Est-ce que.

[Paul Noble]
And what they do is they simply, the French, French speakers will put, "Is it that," in front of a statement. So, for something like, "you can do it today," let's start with that. How would you say, "You can do it today?"

[Marion]
Vous pouvez le faire aujourd'hui?

[Paul Noble]
Now, simply add, "is it that," in front of the sentence and you'll get literally, "Is it that you can do it today?" Which in French m- simply means can you do it today. So, "Is it that you can do it today?"

[Marion]
Est-ce que vous pouvez le faire aujourd'hui?

[Paul Noble]
Let's go back to what we were doing just a moment ago. What is "I can"?

[Marion]
Je peux.

[Paul Noble]
"He can."

[Marion]
Il peut.

[Paul Noble]
"She can."

[Marion]
Elle peut.

[Paul Noble]
"You can."

[Marion]
Vous pouvez.

[Paul Noble]
"Can you eat it?"

[Marion]
Pouvez-vous le manger?

[Paul Noble]
That's one way to do it. Let's try it now with a rising intonation instead.

[Marion]
Vous pouvez le manger?

[Paul Noble]
Finally, you can also use, "Is it that." So, "Is it that you can eat it?"

[Marion]
Est-ce que vous pouvez le manger?

[Paul Noble]
"We can" is rather similar to "you can." It sounds quite similar. As you remember, "you can" was?

[Marion]
Vous pouvez.

[Paul Noble]
"We can" is?

[Marion]
Nous pouvons.

[Paul Noble]
So at the end of "you can," you have an "A" sound. At the end of "we can," you have an, "On" sound. Again, don't concern yourself too much about remembering this. Through the course of these lessons, you'll be able to remember it naturally and without worrying about it anyway. So, how would you say, "we can do it?"

[Marion]
Nous pouvons le faire.

[Paul Noble]
"We can eat it."

[Marion]
Nous pouvons le manger.

[Paul Noble]
"To understand" in French is?

[Marion]
Comprendre.

[Marion]
Comprendre.

[Paul Noble]
How would you say, "We can understand?"

[Marion]
Nous pouvons comprendre.

[Paul Noble]
"To understand it" will be?

[Marion]
Le comprendre.

[Paul Noble]
So how would you say, "We can understand it?"

[Marion]
Nous ne pouvons pas le comprendre.

[Paul Noble]
How about "We can't understand it"?

[Marion]
Nous ne pouvons pas le comprendre.

[Paul Noble]
Let's break that down for a bit. "We can" is?

[Marion]
Nous pouvons.

[Paul Noble]
But to say, "We cannot" is?

[Marion]
Nous ne pouvons pas.

[Paul Noble]
Again, you can see that there is a "pas" on the end, meaning "not," and that there's also a negative warning earlier in the sentence. And these effectively form a sort of sandwich. The "pas" will be one slice of bread. There must be some sort of filling, which in this case is the "pouvons" And then we have the negative warning, the "ne", which is the other slice of bread. So you have the "ne" and the "pas" which make a sandwich. They must have a filling. They're not going to be next to each other. You're not gonna have an empty sandwich. But they will want to have some sort of filling. So again, "we cannot" is?

[Marion]
Nous ne pouvons pas.

[Paul Noble]
And, "We cannot understand it?"

[Marion]
Nous ne pouvons pas le comprendre.

[Paul Noble]
"We cannot eat it."

[Marion]
Nous ne pouvons pas le manger.

[Paul Noble]
"We cannot do it."

[Marion]
Nous ne pouvons pas le faire.

[Paul Noble]
"I cannot do it."

[Marion]
Je ne peux pas le faire.

[Paul Noble]
"He cannot do it."

[Marion]
Il ne peut pas le faire.

[Paul Noble]
"She cannot do it."

[Marion]
Elle ne peut pas le faire.

[Paul Noble]
Again, what is, "you can"?

[Marion]
Vous pouvez.

[Paul Noble]
And, "we can"?

[Marion]
Nous pouvons.

[Paul Noble]
So you'll notice that the, "you", and the, "we" forms are really quite different to the, "I", and the, "he", and the, "she". But quite similar to one another. Again, "you can" is?

[Marion]
Vous pouvez.

[Paul Noble]
And, "we can"?

[Marion]
Nous pouvons.

[Paul Noble]
The word for "they" in French is?

[Marion]
Ils.

[Marion]
Ils.

[Paul Noble]
And the word for "he" in French is also of course?

[Marion]
Il.

[Marion]
Il.

[Paul Noble]
So they sound the same. In order to find "they can," therefore, we can start off by going to "he can" because, well, I mean, they're very similar so probably the word for "can" is going to be similar for them. So what was "he can"?

[Marion]
Il peut.

[Paul Noble]
"They can" is going to start in exactly the same way as-

[Marion]
Il peut.

[Paul Noble]
Except, of course, you're going to need something to distinguish it from "he can." The way you're going to distinguish it from "he can" is by adding an additional consonant sound at the end of the word. The question is, of course, which consonant are you going to choose to distinguish it? Well, you can find the consonant if you look inside "you can."What was "you can"? How would you say "you can" in French?

[Marion]
Vous pouvez.

[Paul Noble]
What you will do is you will take the middle consonant from the "can" from "you can." So "you can" again was?

[Marion]
Vous pouvez.

[Paul Noble]
And you can hear a "V" in the middle of that. It is that "V" sound that you're going to add to the end of "he can," which is going to make it into "they can." So let's go back a second. What was "he can"?

[Marion]
Il peut.

[Paul Noble]
Now add the "V" sound onto the end. What will you have?

[Marion]
Ils peuvent.

[Marion]
Ils peuvent.

[Paul Noble]
So a good way to find the "they can" is simply to go back to "he can" and it will start in the same way, except it will have an additional consonant sound on the end. So how would you say, "They can understand"?

[Marion]
Ils peuvent comprendre.

[Paul Noble]
"They can understand it."

[Marion]
Ils peuvent le comprendre.

[Paul Noble]
The word for "me" in French is"

[Marion]
Me.

[Marion]
Me.

[Paul Noble]
So how would you say "to understand me"?

[Marion]
Me comprendre.

[Paul Noble]
Now, many students will want to put the "me" after "comprendre." But if we simply go back to what we did earlier, it will make sense that it goes in this position. "To understand" is?

[Marion]
Comprendre.

[Paul Noble]
"To understand it" is?

[Marion]
Le comprendre.

[Paul Noble]
And so "to understand me" is?

[Marion]
Me comprendre.

[Paul Noble]
"They can understand me."

[Marion]
Ils peuvent me comprendre.

[Paul Noble]
So "they can" is?

[Marion]
Ils peuvent.

[Paul Noble]
And "to understand me" is?

[Marion]
Me comprendre.

[Paul Noble]
So "they can understand me"?

[Marion]
Ils peuvent me comprendre.

[Paul Noble]
"They cannot understand me."

[Marion]
Ils ne peuvent pas me comprendre.

[Paul Noble]
So the "they can" is?

[Marion]
Ils peuvent.

[Paul Noble]
And "they cannot" is?

[Marion]
Ils ne peuvent pas.

[Paul Noble]
Again, in the negative you have the same components. You have the same "ne" and "pas" added to make it a sandwich. So you have "they can"-

[Marion]
Ils peuvent.

[Paul Noble]
Then we add a "pas" after the "peuvent" and a "ne," just the sound of an "N" almost, before the "peuvent," making a little sandwich of it. "Ne peuvent pas."

[Paul Noble]
"They cannot."

[Marion]
Ils ne peuvent pas.

[Paul Noble]
"They cannot understand it."

[Marion]
Ils ne peuvent pas le comprendre.

[Paul Noble]
"They cannot understand me."

[Marion]
Ils ne peuvent pas me comprendre.

[Paul Noble]
The word for "you" that we have been using the whole way through is of course?

[Marion]
Vous.

[Paul Noble]
How about, "They cannot understand you?" Let's start with "they cannot."

[Marion]
Ils ne peuvent pas.

[Paul Noble]
"Understand you."

[Marion]
Vous comprendre.

[Paul Noble]
Again, it will be in the same position as before. So "to understand it" is?

[Marion]
Le comprendre.

[Paul Noble]
"To understand me."

[Marion]
Me comprendre.

[Paul Noble]
And "to understand you."

[Marion]
Vous comprendre.

[Paul Noble]
Back to the beginning again. What was "I can"?

[Marion]
Je peux.

[Paul Noble]
"He can."

[Marion]
Il peut.

[Paul Noble]
"She can."

[Marion]
Elle peut.

[Paul Noble]
"You can."

[Marion]
Vous pouvez.

[Paul Noble]
"We can."

[Marion]
Nous pouvons.

[Paul Noble]
Finally, "they can."

[Marion]
Ils peuvent.

[Paul Noble]
If you forget what the "they can" form is, simply start by going back to "he can," which of course starts in the same way with "il peut." You then only need to remember what ver-, which particular consonant sound it is that needs to be added to the ending. In this case, it's a "V" sound.

[Paul Noble]
Again, how would you say, "I can do it?"

[Marion]
Je peux le faire.

[Paul Noble]
"I can eat it."

[Marion]
Je peux le manger.

[Paul Noble]
Now make sure, um, at the end of these words, which, for instance, "manger," to really sound that "A" sound at the end. So you've got "to eat," which is?

[Marion]
Manger.

[Paul Noble]
"To prepare," which is?

[Marion]
Préparer.

[Paul Noble]
"To visit," which is?

[Marion]
Visiter.

[Paul Noble]
So you'll see a lot of words have that "A" sound at the end. And make sure to make that nice and clear. It helps you to be understood. "To see" in French, "to see" is?

[Marion]
Voir.

[Paul Noble]
How would you say, "To see it"?

[Marion]
Le voir.

[Paul Noble]
How would you say, "I can see it"?

[Marion]
Je peux le voir.

[Paul Noble]
"He can see it."

[Marion]
Il peut le voir.

[Paul Noble]
"She can see it."

[Marion]
Elle peut le voir.

[Paul Noble]
"You can see it."

[Marion]
Vous pouvez le voir.

[Paul Noble]
"We can see it."

[Marion]
Nous pouvons le voir.

[Paul Noble]
"They can see it."

[Marion]
Ils peuvent le voir.

[Paul Noble]
Again, if you find yourself particularly struggling with any of these, feel free to go back a track and have another practice. The second time it's always far, far easier. All right. To say, "To see her," in French, you will say?

[Marion]
La voir.

[Marion]
La voir.

[Paul Noble]
So it sounds slightly different than, "To see it." So, "I can see her"?

[Marion]
Je peux la voir.

[Paul Noble]
Make sure to make the "her" very clearly end in an "A" sound as-

[Marion]
La.

[Paul Noble]
"He can see her."

[Marion]
Il peut la voir.

[Paul Noble]
"She can see her."

[Marion]
Elle peut la voir.

[Paul Noble]
"You can see her."

[Marion]
Vous pouvez la voir.

[Paul Noble]
Now, switching the, the word order, so switching it from "you can" to "can you," how would you say, "Can you see her?"

[Marion]
Pouvez-vous la voir?

[Paul Noble]
How about using "est-ce que" and say, "Is it that you can see her?"

[Marion]
Est-ce que vous pouvez la voir?

[Paul Noble]
Finally, let's try it with the rising intonation and say, "You can see her?"

[Marion]
Vous pouvez la voir?

[Paul Noble]
So how would you say, "To eat?"

[Marion]
Manger.

[Paul Noble]
"To eat it."

[Marion]
Le manger.

[Paul Noble]
"To see."

[Marion]
Voir.

[Paul Noble]
"To see it."

[Marion]
Le voir.

[Paul Noble]
"I can see it."

[Marion]
Je peux le voir.

[Paul Noble]
"I can see her."

[Marion]
Je peux la voir.

[Paul Noble]
How would you say, "I have a room for two people for two nights"?

[Marion]
J'ai une chambre pour deux personnes pour deux nuits.

[Paul Noble]
And perhaps that room would be with a shower. How would you say, "With shower"?

[Marion]
Avec douche.

[Paul Noble]
In French, the "A" is not necessarily necessary, so one can simply say, "With shower," which again was?

[Marion]
Avec douche.

[Paul Noble]
So how would you say, "I have a room for two people for two nights with shower"?

[Marion]
J'ai une chambre pour deux personnes pour deux nuits avec douche.

[Paul Noble]
Now, if someone tells you you have a roo- they have a room like that available, you might ask to see it. How would you say in French, "I can see it"?

[Marion]
Je peux la voir?

[Paul Noble]
Now, you may have noticed that rather than saying the, the 'it' we've been practicing with, which would be, for, "I can see it," it would be?

[Marion]
Le.

[Paul Noble]
We instead said-

[Marion]
La.

[Paul Noble]
That might seem very odd. Well, in French you could, you could definitely get away with saying, "I can see it," using 'it.' It probably wouldn't even be particularly noticed. You could simply say-

[Marion]
Je peux le voir?

[Paul Noble]
However, if we're going to be incredibly accurate and correct in our French, the room itself is actually feminine. I mean, most people are familiar with the idea there are masculine and feminine things in French, just as there are masculine and feminine in English, but in a much more limited way. In English, for instance, if you said something like, "I have a sister," the person, if they wanted to see her, they would say, "Can I see her?" It would be very strange if you said, "I have a sister," and they replied, "Can I see it?" It would sound a bit rude or unpleasant. In French, however, general everyday objects have genders. They are masculine or feminine, male or female. What this means is, is that if you are being very accurate in your spoken French, when you're talking about a female object and referring to it, you refer to it as 'her' or 'she.' And if you're talking about a male or masculine object, you refer to it as 'he' or 'him.' That seems a little odd to us as English speakers, but it's not as if it's completely unfamiliar. For instance, if you think about a ship, we may sometimes refer to a ship as 'she.' We might say, "We've launched the ship. She's a beauty." Well, it's the same idea in French. So as you're talking about a room, which happens to be feminine, how would you say, "I can see it"? Literally, "I can see her."

[Marion]
Je peux la voir?

[Paul Noble]
However, this is not something to worry about tremendously in French. There's two key reasons for this. Um, the most important is that when French people speak, they tend to do so fairly quickly. And the Ls and the Las tend to be obscured slightly simply by how they're pronounced. So you may hear, "I can see it," as a quite blurred-

[Marion]
Je peux le voir.

[Marion]
Je peux le voir?

[Paul Noble]
Yeah. It won't necessarily be entirely clear. So it's not something to worry about too much, but be aware of its existence. So one more time, in asking to see the room, how would you say, "I can see it?" "I can see her?"

[Marion]
Je peux la voir?

[Paul Noble]
Now let's look at a couple of the things that might come with the room. We've looked at, "With shower," which is?

[Marion]
Avec douche.

[Paul Noble]
But you might also have the option of having one that comes "with breakfast," which would be?

[Marion]
Avec petit déjeuner.

[Paul Noble]
So the word for "breakfast" is?

[Marion]
Petit déjeuner.

[Paul Noble]
Literally it means, "Small lunch." "Déjeuner" is "lunch" and "petit" is "small." So "petit déjeuner," and we have "small lunch." So how would you say, "With breakfast"?

[Marion]
Avec petit déjeuner.

[Paul Noble]
How would you say, "I would like a room for two people for two nights with breakfast"?

[Marion]
Je voudrais une chambre pour deux personnes pour deux nuits avec petit déjeuner.

[Paul Noble]
Anyway, let's imagine for a moment that you've gone up to see this room. Um, how would you say, "It's fantastic"?

[Marion]
C'est fantastique.

[Paul Noble]
Another word in French that might be sort of familiar to English speakers is, "Perfect." Perfect is not exactly the same in French, but it's similar. To say, "Perfect," in French, you'll say?

[Marion]
Parfait.

[Marion]
Parfait.

[Paul Noble]
So how would you say, "It's perfect"?

[Marion]
C'est parfait.

[Paul Noble]
Of course, one other issue with your room is going to be the fact that you're going to need to ask how much it is. For this in French, you might simply say, "It's how much?" Which is?

[Marion]
C'est combien?

[Marion]
C'est combien?

[Paul Noble]
The word for "how much" sounds a little bit like the "combin" in "combination" but it's instead, instead it's "combien."

[Marion]
Combien.

[Paul Noble]
So again, how would you say, "It's how much?"

[Marion]
C'est combien?

[Paul Noble]
So again, what is "it is," on its own?

[Marion]
C'est.

[Paul Noble]
Now, on the front of "it is" in French, you can hear a sort of "c" sound, which is the "it." But the "is" on its own, if you don't have "it is," if you just have the "is," the "is" on its own is?

[Marion]
Est.

[Marion]
Est.

[Paul Noble]
With that in mind, how would you say, "The breakfast is fantastic"?

[Marion]
Le petit déjeuner est fantastique.

[Paul Noble]
How about, "The room is fantastic"?

[Marion]
La chambre est fantastique.

[Paul Noble]
"Your mother" in French is?

[Marion]
Votre mère.

[Paul Noble]
How would you say, "Your mother is fantastic"?

[Marion]
Votre mère est fantastique.

[Paul Noble]
How about, "Your father is exotic"?

[Marion]
Votre père est exotique.

[Paul Noble]
To say "your name" in French, "your name," "your name" is?

[Marion]
Votre nom.

[Marion]
Votre nom.

[Paul Noble]
Now, you may be familiar with the word for "name" because we use it in English sometimes. For instance, we might say, "Nom de plume." Except we don't pronounce it very correctly because "name" is pronounced?

[Marion]
Nom.

[Paul Noble]
It's spelled N-O-M, but is "M" in "for luck"? No, it isn't. And so the "M" is not clearly pronounced. How would you say, "Your name is Exotic"?

[Marion]
Votre nom est exotique.

[Paul Noble]
"Your name is Paul."

[Marion]
Votre nom est Paul.

[Paul Noble]
What is, "to visit", in French?

[Marion]
Visiter.

[Paul Noble]
"To reserve"?

[Marion]
Réserver.

[Paul Noble]
So as you can see, there are a lot of words you can use in French which are very similar to the English, except they have an "A" sound on the end. Sometimes there are minor variations or the English word you would expect to be used is slightly different. An example of this is, "to stay" in French. "To stay" in French is not "stayer" but instead it is "to rest." So how do you think you'd say, "to stay," in French, considering that really it's "to rest"?

[Marion]
Rester.

[Paul Noble]
"To camp." Well, "to camp" is almost identical, except it's pronounced in a French way. What do you think, "to camp," will be?

[Marion]
Camper.

[Paul Noble]
"To pay." "To pay" is even easier. It, it is the same except obviously you've got the added bit on the end. So "to pay" will be?

[Marion]
Payer.

[Paul Noble]
How do you think you would say, "you pay"?

[Marion]
Vous payez.

[Paul Noble]
So for "you," for, for the "pay" for "you," it simply sounds exactly the same as "to pay." So let's do that again. "To pay."

[Marion]
Payer.

[Paul Noble]
And "you pay."

[Marion]
Vous payez.

[Paul Noble]
So if "you pay" is?

[Marion]
Vous payez.

[Paul Noble]
How would you make that into a question and literally say, "Pay you", or, "Are you paying?"

[Marion]
Payez-vous?

[Paul Noble]
The word for "how" in French is?

[Marion]
Comment.

[Marion]
Comment.

[Paul Noble]
So how would you say, "How are you paying? How pay you?"

[Marion]
Comment payez-vous?

[Paul Noble]
Do you remember how to say, "It's how much"?

[Marion]
C'est combien?

[Paul Noble]
And then of course, once you've asked how much it is, they're likely to ask you, "How are you paying?" Which would be, "How pay you?"

[Marion]
Comment payez-vous?

[Paul Noble]
Obviously there are various ways you could pay. Let's try paying with a credit card. A credit card in French, to say, "with a credit card" in French, you'll simply say, "With a card of credit." With a card of credit. And say it in a French way. So how would you say that, "With a card of credit"?

[Marion]
Avec une carte de crédit.

[Paul Noble]
The word for "of" of course is?

[Marion]
De.

[Paul Noble]
And so "with a card of" would be?

[Marion]
Avec une carte de.

[Paul Noble]
And "credit" is?

[Marion]
Crédit.

[Paul Noble]
'Cause the "T" is not pronounced obviously because it's not in "for luck." So one more time, "with a credit card" would be?

[Marion]
Avec une carte de crédit.

[Paul Noble]
So how would you say using intonation to ask a question, "I can pay with a credit card?" "I can pay with a card of credit?"

[Marion]
Je peux payer avec une carte de crédit?

[Paul Noble]
Here are the numbers one to twenty, for those of you who aren't entirely familiar with them. You'll find the rest of the French numbers, both at the end of your CDs and in the supporting booklet. So let's begin. The numbers one to twenty in French.

[Paul Noble]

[Marion]

[Paul Noble]
I think now you probably know enough in order to book yourself into a hotel room. Except just to make sure you really understand the French, you're going to do both parts. So you're going to, uh, book yourself into a hotel, and then you're going to work out what the likely response of the receptionist or the concierge is going to be. Okay. I want you to start by saying, "I would like a room for two people for two nights."

[Marion]
Je voudrais une chambre pour deux personnes pour deux nuits.

[Paul Noble]
The receptionist is going to respond by saying, "I have a room for two people with shower."

[Marion]
J'ai une chambre pour deux personnes avec douche.

[Paul Noble]
Ask them how much it is by saying, "It's how much?"

[Marion]
C'est combien?

[Paul Noble]
They reply, "Mm, for two nights with breakfast, a hundred euros." So, "For two nights with breakfast."

[Marion]
Pour deux nuits, avec petit déjeuner.

[Paul Noble]
"One hundred euros."

[Marion]
Cent euros.

[Paul Noble]
Again, notice the way "euro" is said in French.

[Marion]
Euro.

[Paul Noble]
Okay, you need to get used to that pronunciation. If you do pronounce it in an English way, you'll be understood obviously, particularly in the context, but do get some practice saying that. Okay, so they've offered you the room. You're now going to say, um, "Can I see it?" "I, I can see it." "I can see her."

[Marion]
Je peux la voir?

[Paul Noble]
The receptionist, of course, says, "Yes."

[Marion]
Oui.

[Paul Noble]
You go up to the room, and, mm, given the price it's not bad. So say, "Ah, yes, it's perfect."

[Marion]
Ah, oui, c'est parfait.

[Paul Noble]
You go back down to the reception, and the receptionist says, "Your name, please." How would you say that?

[Marion]
Votre nom, s'il vous plaît?

[Paul Noble]
You may or may not be familiar with the word for "please" already in French. A lot of people are. Literally it means "if it pleases you." And again, "please" in French is?

[Marion]
S'il vous plaît.

[Marion]
S'il vous plaît.

[Paul Noble]
You'll be hearing it a lot during this course, so don't worry about it if you're not familiar with it already. Okay, now, you've got to give your name. Now, that's interesting. Well, for the sake of argument, we're going to say you are called, mm, let's say Mr. or Mrs. Moon. That's a nice simple name. And when you give your name in French, it is best to spell it afterwards, because the pronunciation diff- difference will often make it difficult for the French person to know how to spell the name. The alphabet is given in this course at the end of the CDs, and you can check that later. It's also in the accompanying booklet. Okay, so let's try and spell your name. So first, give your surname, which is going to be "Moon."

[Marion]
Moon.

[Paul Noble]
And then you're going to spell it. Now, I want you to spell it just as you would in English, but try to make the letters sound a bit more French. So how would you spell "Moon" in French?

[Marion]
M-O-O-N.

[Paul Noble]
Now, obviously not all letters are going to be that easy in French, but some of them are. Some of them are just the same or very similar to the English. Again, the ones that are different, you can learn them with the last track on the CDs. Okay. So you've given your name, and the receptionist is going to ask you, "How are you paying? How pay you?" How will she say that?

[Marion]
Comment payez-vous?

[Paul Noble]
Um, and you're going to reply to that and say, um, "I can pay with a credit card. I can pay with a card of credit."

[Marion]
Je peux payer avec une carte de credit?

[Paul Noble]
Uh, the receptionist says, "Yes."

[Marion]
Oui.

[Paul Noble]
You say thank you after she debits your card.

[Marion]
Merci.

[Paul Noble]
And she, of course, will also say, "Thank you."

[Marion]
Merci.

[Paul Noble]
You may remember from the very, very beginning of the course, the French word for "campsite." Do you remember what that was?

[Marion]
Le camping.

[Paul Noble]
So "to camp" is?

[Marion]
Camper.

[Paul Noble]
But "the campsite" is?

[Marion]
Le camping.

[Paul Noble]
Um, do you remember what "the weekend" was?

[Marion]
Le week-end.

[Paul Noble]
So again, there are groups of words that are quite similar to the English. What about the "car park" or "parking lot"?

[Marion]
Le parking.

[Paul Noble]
You'll notice a lot of them have -ing on the end. Again, this is typical of words that've been imported to French. So, um, to say, "Where is" in French, "Where is," you will say?

[Marion]
Où est.

[Paul Noble]
The "est" is the "is" that we've been using already, and "where" is"

[Marion]
Où

[Paul Noble]
And "where is" together again is?

[Marion]
Où est.

[Paul Noble]
So how would you say, "Where is the car park?" "Where is the parking?"

[Marion]
Où est le parking?

[Paul Noble]
What was "the campsite"? How did we say that?

[Marion]
Le camping.

[Paul Noble]
How would you say, "Where is the campsite?"

[Marion]
Où est le camping?

[Paul Noble]
The word for "there" in French, "there," is?

[Marion]
Là-bas.

[Paul Noble]
And you can also shorten it to?

[Marion]
Là.

[Paul Noble]
"Là" on its own really means "there," just there. It's normally somewhere you can point to, typically. It's somewhere within pointing distance. And "là-bas" means something closer to "over there." The word "bas" on it, which is spelled B-A-S, is related to the English word "base." So when people in French say, "Là-bas," it's like saying, "There at the base, down there, over there." And "là" on its own can just mean "there." Uh, both are very usable and "là-bas" is very commonly used. Um, how would you say, "The campsite is over there"?

[Marion]
Le camping est là-bas.

[Paul Noble]
You'll find that a lot of vocabulary for camping in French actually is, is the same as the English. A lot of it's very familiar. So obviously we have "campsite," which is?

[Marion]
Camping.

[Paul Noble]
We have "to camp," which is?

[Marion]
Camper.

[Paul Noble]
We have "a tent," which is?

[Marion]
Une tente.

[Paul Noble]
Or "a caravan" which is?

[Marion]
Une caravane.

[Paul Noble]
And so camping using French tends, uh, to be fairly easy.

[Narrator]
This is the end of CD 2.
