# Dark Mallard: The Real Story

## Mission Brief: Find Agent Stella Morrison

**Stella Morrison**: CIA operative, 18 months deep cover in Paris
**Last contact**: 3 weeks ago from Belleville district  
**Assignment**: Investigating the Moreau family's political destabilization campaign
**Status**: Missing (captured/hiding/compromised - unknown)

## The Target: The Moreau Network

### What Stella Was Investigating

**Infrastructure Targets:**

- Small business "accidents" - gas leaks, electrical fires, health violations
- Public transport "delays" and "maintenance issues"  
- Immigrant business harassment disguised as "concerned citizens"

**The Pattern Stella Found:**
All incidents trace back to Moreau shell companies and paid agitators
Timeline perfectly coincides with electoral cycle
Brother's campaign materials were being printed months before "spontaneous" candidacy

## The Real Conflict

Not moral choices, but **operational trade-offs**:

- **Language vs. Technology**: Learn French vs. rely on tech crutches
- **Trust vs. Control**: Build relationships vs. use leverage

This is **pure espionage thriller**. Every conversation is intelligence gathering. Every relationship is operational. Every language mistake could blow your cover or get someone killed.

The question isn't "Are you a good person?"
