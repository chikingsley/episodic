# Dark Mallard: Story V1 - The Leclerc Investigation

You land at Charles de Gaulle with Sheldon. The mission brief is simple: find CIA operative Stella, missing for two weeks while investigating the Leclerc family. Duane Leclerc and his political operation. Thirty days until the election.

Your French is garbage. Sheldon knows this. "Language failures will force you into compromises," he warns. "Every conversation you can't handle naturally pushes you toward methods that damage your operational integrity."

Three meters track your survival:

- **Cover Integrity** (individual suspicion - does this person think you're CIA?)
- **Network Trust** (community reputation - what do people say about you?)  
- **Handler Confidence** (agency support - do your handlers trust your judgment?)

Drop any below 30% and mission paths close. Drop two below 50% and extraction becomes mandatory.

**Day 1: The Concierge - Your First Choice**

Stella's apartment building. The concierge knows something. Before you speak, Sheldon coaches you on approach:

*Professional Approach:* "Be respectful, show credentials, keep it business. Lower suspicion but limited intel access."

*Vulnerable Approach:* "Personal concern for missing friend. Higher empathy but he might try to 'help' in ways that compromise you."

*Romantic Approach:* "This is an older man. Flirt subtly, build intimate connection. Deep intel access but ongoing emotional obligations."

You choose Professional. "Bonjour monsieur. Je cherche une amie... Stella. Une femme américaine." Your pronunciation is terrible but your respectful tone registers.

**Success Path:** He notices your accent but appreciates your politeness. "Américaine, oui. Police already ask questions." Cover Integrity: 90% (respectful foreign visitor, not suspicious). He mentions police searched her apartment last week. Small intel gain, no complications.

**Failure Path:** You panic when he responds too fast, check your phone immediately. His suspicion spikes. "Vous êtes police?" Now you need crisis management. Use blackmail material (60% confidence photos), abort and lose the lead, or let Sheldon coach you through earpiece (drops Handler Confidence).

**Handler Debrief Choice:**

- *"The professional approach worked well."* → Handler Confidence +5%
- *"I should have been more aggressive."* → Sheldon disagrees, Handler Confidence -5%
- *"My French isn't good enough for this."* → Sheldon: "That's why we practice. Let me coach you better next time."

**Day 3: Market Intelligence - When French Fails**

Madame Chen, the produce vendor. Basic Pimsleur conversation works: "Combien pour les pommes?" "Trois euros." But when you ask about Stella, she gets nervous, speaking rapid French mixed with Mandarin. You catch "dangereuse" and "Leclerc" but miss critical context.

Your choice when communication breaks down:

*Phone Translation:* Check your phone for vocabulary. Cover Integrity -10% (she notices you're using translation), but you understand she's scared of Leclerc's people threatening vendors.

*Echo Method:* Repeat words back to her. "Dangereuse? Leclerc?" She explains slowly. Cover Integrity maintained, but limited information.

*Emotional Mirror:* Match her worried tone. "Vous avez peur?" You catch her fear but not specific details. She trusts you more but gives vague warnings.

**Success Path (Echo Method):** Your patient approach works. She explains slowly: "L'américaine... elle pose trop de questions. Leclerc's people... they visit shops. Stella take pictures." Network Trust +10% (respectful interaction with vendor). Intel: Stella was documenting harassment.

**Pressure Path (Threat Immigration):** "Papiers... problèmes?" Her face goes white. She breaks immediately, gives everything about Stella's investigation. But word spreads fast in Belleville. Network Trust -25% (threatening immigrants). Handler Confidence -15% (Sheldon: "We protect civilians, we don't threaten them").

**Helper Path (Offer Assistance):** "Je peux aider avec Leclerc." Costs 2 days and resources, but Network Trust +20%. Chen becomes an active asset, reports Leclerc activities. Long-term intelligence benefit.

Network Trust after Day 3:

- Success: 60%
- Pressure: 25%
- Helper: 70%

**Day 5: The Civil Servant Crisis - Meter States Matter**

François in city planning. Your approach depends on your current standing:

**If Network Trust is High (70%):** Chen mentioned you to her cousin who works in permits. François greets you warmly. "Madame Chen says you're helping with the Leclerc problem. How can I assist?" Voluntary cooperation. No blackmail needed.

**If Network Trust is Medium (60%):** François is cautious but polite. You need to build rapport first. Professional conversation about permits leads to him mentioning "irregular approvals." Gentle pressure works: "Stella noticed these patterns too?" He admits to rushed permits but needs reassurance you're not investigating him personally.

**If Network Trust is Low (25%):** François is immediately suspicious. "Another American asking about permits?" He's heard you threaten people. Only blackmail works now, but it's risky in a government building.

*Blackmail Route:* "Votre femme sait que vous jouez?" 85% confidence on gambling debts. His face goes white. He breaks, gives everything: Leclerc company buying up Belleville, Stella's documentation. But other employees notice his distress. Cover Integrity -20%. Three days later, François's suicide makes local news. Handler Confidence -20% (Sheldon: "We destroyed a civilian"). Network Trust -15% (community blames outside pressure).

**Handler Debrief Matters:**

- *"Sometimes pressure is necessary."* → Handler Confidence -10% more
- *"I didn't expect him to break that badly."* → Sheldon: "That's why we build rapport first. Blackmail should be last resort."
- *"I should have found another way."* → Handler Confidence -5% (shows learning)

**Day 8: Cascading Consequences**

Jean-Luc the bartender. Your approach depends on how your reputation has developed:

**High Trust Path (Network Trust 70%):** Jean-Luc approaches you. "Chen says you're fighting Leclerc. My friends want to meet you." No persuasion needed. The community vouches for you. Access to resistance network with full support.

**Medium Trust Path (Network Trust 60%):** Jean-Luc is cautious but willing to listen. You need to prove yourself. "What did you really think of Stella?" Your answer matters. Show respect for her mission and you're in. Show ignorance and you're out.

**Low Trust Path (Network Trust 25%):** Jean-Luc is hostile. "You're the American causing problems." He's heard about François, about threats to Chen. Your only option is leverage: "Leclerc's people will shut this bar down next month." Now he needs you more than he distrusts you.

**Crisis Point - Language Failure:** Regardless of trust level, when Jean-Luc starts talking politics, your French fails. "La résistance n'est pas seulement..." You miss key concepts.

Your options:

- *Phone Translation:* Cover Integrity -15%, but you understand the resistance plans
- *Echo Method:* "Résistance... comment?" Limited understanding but natural conversation  
- *Sheldon Coaching:* Handler Confidence -10% (he's exposed), but perfect responses

**Day 12: Two Different Evaluations**

**Success Track Debrief:**
Network Trust: 70%, Handler Confidence: 80%, Cover Integrity: 85%

Sheldon: "Outstanding work. You're building genuine community support. François cooperated voluntarily. The resistance trusts you. This is how operations should run."

**Failure Track Debrief:**
Network Trust: 25%, Handler Confidence: 45%, Cover Integrity: 55%

Sheldon: "Your methods are burning assets. François is dead. The community fears you. We need to extract you before this gets worse."

Below 50% Handler Confidence: No more high-quality intel, no backup, no benefit of the doubt.
Below 30% on any meter: Mission paths start closing permanently.

**Day 15: Two Different Worlds**

**Success Track (Network Trust 70%, Handler Confidence 80%):**

Ahmed the butcher greets you warmly. "The American who helps against Leclerc! Chen told me everything. You want to know about Stella?" He volunteers information freely. Location: warehouse in Ivry. Three guards, shift change at midnight. "My cousin works there - he can help." Community resources available. No violence needed.

**Failure Track (Network Trust 25%, Handler Confidence 45%):**

Ahmed speaks in English: "You're the American who destroyed François. People who talk to you die." No blackmail works - your reputation precedes you. Only option is direct threat: "Immigration raids this market tomorrow unless you talk." Network Trust drops to 10%. Information extracted but community turns completely hostile.

**Day 18: Two Different Endings**

**Success Ending (High Meters):**
Network Trust: 70%, Handler Confidence: 80%, Cover Integrity: 85%

Community-supported rescue. Ahmed's cousin lets you into the warehouse. "American friend?" You nod. Guards are distracted by Jean-Luc's resistance friends creating diversion. Stella extraction with full community support. "Merci beaucoup pour votre aide." Your French is good enough now to thank them properly.

Sheldon: "Textbook operation. Community trust, minimal violence, successful extraction. This is how it's done."

**Failure Ending (Low Meters):**
Network Trust: 10%, Handler Confidence: 30%, Cover Integrity: 30%

Solo infiltration attempt. "Je livre des médicaments." Your pronunciation so bad guard immediately knows you're not French. Cover blown, alarm raised. Fight through three guards with stolen weapons. Carry unconscious Stella through hostile neighborhood where everyone recognizes you as the American who threatens people.

Sheldon (if you survive): "You got her out, but you burned everything. No more operations in this sector for five years."

**The Choice System:**

Your conversation approach choices create these outcomes. Professional respect builds lasting relationships. Helping communities creates genuine support. Learning French naturally reduces dependence on manipulation.

But threatening civilians burns trust forever. Using blackmail creates fear that spreads. Phone dependency signals weakness and foreignness.

Three meters. Thirty days. Every conversation choice matters because reputation is everything in intelligence work.

**The Leclerc Family Response:**

Whether you succeed or fail depends on operational capability, not their direct interference. Duane, Fabien, and Liliane operate their political destabilization campaign while you either:

- Build enough community trust and language skills to stop them through legitimate intelligence gathering
- Burn so many bridges that you can't operate effectively, letting their plan succeed by default

Your conversation competence determines mission outcome. They don't need to be action movie villains - they just need to be stopped by someone who can actually function in their environment.

That's Dark Mallard with stakes that matter.
