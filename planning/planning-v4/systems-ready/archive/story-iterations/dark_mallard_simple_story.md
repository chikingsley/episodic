You land at Charles de Gaulle with one mission: find Stella Morrison. CIA operative, missing for three weeks, last seen in Belleville asking questions about the Moreau family. Duane Moreau and his brother are planning something big before the election in 45 days.

Your French is shit. You can say "Bonjour" and "Où est..." and that's about it. But Stella's life depends on you figuring this out.

The concierge at her apartment building knows something. You can tell by how he shifts when you mention her name. "Une femme américaine... Stella... vous la connaissez?" His eyes dart around. Your pronunciation is terrible and he's getting suspicious. You check your phone for better words and his suspicion goes up another 15%. Now he's asking if you're police.

You have intel on him from the handler. Photos with an underage prostitute. 60% confidence - could be his cousin, could be fake. If you're wrong, he calls the real police. If you're right, he tells you Stella's apartment was searched by Moreau's people two weeks ago.

The market vendor Madame Chen saw Stella regularly. Basic conversation: "Combien pour les pommes?" Three euros. But when you ask about Stella, she gets nervous. Your French is improving but she's speaking too fast, mixing in Mandarin. You catch "dangereuse" and "Moreau." She's scared.

You could bribe her. Twenty euros for information. Or you could use what the handler told you about her immigration status. The paperwork problems that could get her deported. She has kids. You watch her face when you mention "papiers" and "problèmes." She breaks.

Stella was asking about construction permits. Weekly visits to city hall. Meeting with François in the planning office. He's your next target.

François is nervous, sweating before you even mention Stella. The handler's intel is better on him: gambling debts, 40,000 euros to some very bad people. 85% confidence. When you ask about American woman and construction permits, he says he knows nothing. His hands are shaking.

"Votre femme sait que vous jouez?" Does your wife know you gamble? His face goes white. He starts talking fast, explaining how Moreau company permits got rushed through, how they're buying up Belleville block by block. How Stella had photocopied everything before someone discovered her.

Now you know where she was going wrong. Too direct, too American. Left a trail. The handler teaches you better conversation tactics. How to fish for information without seeming like you're fishing. How to echo words you don't understand to get people to explain more. How to use your foreignness as an asset instead of a liability.

Ahmed the butcher protects his community. He's not talking to another outsider, especially one who can barely speak French. But you learn he knows about Moreau's "security" people, the ones who visit shops and suggest they might have "accidents" if they don't sell.

You have to prove you're not working for Moreau. Help with a real problem - his rival shop is getting harassed. Or give him information that only someone fighting Moreau would have. Or threaten him with immigration raids you can't actually call. Each choice changes how much he trusts you, how much he'll help.

The student bartender Jean-Luc is recruiting for resistance meetings. Midnight tomorrow, back room of the bar. Miss it and you lose access to the underground network. Show up and you're exposed to anyone watching. The handler coaches you through the decision: Pane says use them as a distraction, burn them when necessary. Sheldon says authentic relationships provide better intelligence than manipulation.

Your French is getting better through necessity. When someone's holding a knife to your throat asking who you work for, you learn to say "Je suis journaliste" very quickly and convincingly. When the gambling addict needs to explain money laundering fast before his boss comes back, you learn to understand complex financial vocabulary through pure adrenaline.

Three weeks in, you find Stella. She's alive, barely, in a warehouse in Ivry. The guard speaks no English. You have ninety seconds to convince him you're delivering medical supplies, get past him, and extract an unconscious CIA operative. Your vocabulary fails you. Your phone's battery is dead. You have blackmail material on him - photos of him selling drugs to kids - but it's only 40% confidence. Could be his brother. Could be old.

You use it anyway. "J'ai des photos de toi avec les enfants et la drogue." I have photos of you with children and drugs. He goes pale, steps aside. Wrong choice. It wasn't him in the photos. But his reaction tells you he's guilty of something else, something worse. He helps you carry Stella out, begging you not to tell anyone what you saw.

Stella's been tortured but she's conscious. She knows about the election day bombing. Voting stations across Paris. Moreau's brother becomes president in the chaos, promises law and order. Five days until the election. Your French is good enough now to coordinate with police, to explain bomb locations, to evacuate buildings.

But Duane Moreau knows you're CIA now. He wants to trade Stella's freedom for classified information on American operations in France. The conversation happens in rapid French with no time for translation apps. Your linguistic limitations force you into choices: agree to things you don't understand, or watch Stella die while you check your phone.

You've become someone different in six weeks. Someone who threatens shopkeepers with deportation to get intelligence. Someone who blackmails civil servants to access classified documents. Someone who uses people's love against them to gather information. The handler tracks every choice, every moral compromise. Your character arc is written in the blackmail material you've collected and the relationships you've destroyed.

The bombing is stopped. The election continues. Moreau's brother loses. Stella survives but she's not the same person who went missing. Neither are you. The handler asks if you're ready for the next assignment. There's always another missing operative, another conspiracy, another 45 days to save lives by becoming someone you don't recognize.

That's Dark Mallard. You learn French by necessity. You develop relationships for intelligence. You make moral compromises for operational success. Every conversation skill you develop serves the mission. Every vocabulary word you memorize keeps people alive. Every cultural understanding you gain enables deeper infiltration into networks planning mass murder.

The language learning is invisible because it's survival. The social dynamics are complex because real relationships are complex. The moral choices matter because people die based on what you decide. It's not a game about learning French. It's a spy thriller where learning French is how you save lives.
