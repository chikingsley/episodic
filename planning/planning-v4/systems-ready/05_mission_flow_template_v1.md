# Mission Flow Template v1

## Mission Architecture Overview

Every Dark Mallard mission follows a structured 5-phase flow that integrates language learning, social dynamics, and narrative progression. This template ensures consistent quality while allowing for mission-specific customization.

## Phase 1: Mission Briefing (2-3 minutes)

### Narrative Context Establishment

**Story Integration:**

- Connect to previous mission outcomes
- Establish current operational objectives
- Introduce new characters and relationships
- Preview cultural/social challenges

**Intelligence Preview:**

- Mission-critical information provided
- Handler assessment of player readiness
- Risk factors and potential complications
- Success criteria and failure consequences

### Vocabulary Domain Introduction

**Contextual Preview:**

- Key phrases presented through mission scenario
- Cultural context explanation provided
- Handler coaching philosophy preview
- Pronunciation and usage modeling

**Template Example:**

```markdown
Handler: "Your target is [Character Name], a [Role] who [Key Behavior Pattern]. 
You'll need to [Mission Objective]. Listen to this conversation..."

[Audio: Native speaker interaction in target context]

Handler: "Notice how they say [Key Phrase] - this shows [Cultural Context]. 
You'll practice this in the Chamber before deployment."
```

### Session Type Determination

**Adaptive Briefing:**

- Quick Session: Focus on single conversation objective
- Standard Session: Full mission with complete preparation
- Extended Session: Multi-objective mission with complex social dynamics

## Phase 2: Handler Training Chamber (3-12 minutes)

### Vocabulary Acquisition Sequence

#### Step 2.1: Conversation Deconstruction (2-4 minutes)

**Process:**

- Full native conversation playback
- Phrase-by-phrase isolation and practice
- Pronunciation modeling with backward buildup
- Cultural context integration
- Meaning through usage demonstration

**Template Structure:**

```markdown
1. Full Conversation Audio (30 seconds)
2. Key Phrase Isolation (3-5 phrases)
3. Pronunciation Practice (backward buildup method)
4. Context Explanation (cultural significance)
5. Variation Introduction (alternative phrasings)
```

#### Step 2.2: Contextual Drilling (3-5 minutes)

**Process:**

- Handler-guided response practice
- 2-3 second response timing pressure
- Mission context maintained throughout
- Error correction with immediate repetition
- Progressive complexity introduction

**Template Structure:**

```markdown
Handler: [Context Setting] + [Response Prompt]
Player: [3-second response window]
Handler: [Correction/Encouragement] + [Next Prompt]
```

#### Step 2.3: Simulation Practice (3-5 minutes)

**Process:**

- AI character interaction simulation
- Mission-relevant conversation practice
- Handler coaching available via earpiece
- Performance assessment and confidence building
- Mission readiness determination

### Chamber Type Selection

**Based on Mission Requirements:**

- Type 1 (Deconstruction): New vocabulary domains
- Type 2 (Drilling): Rapid response preparation
- Type 3 (Social Pressure): Relationship-building missions
- Type 4 (Mission Rehearsal): Complex operational scenarios

## Phase 3: Simulation Environment (0-5 minutes)

### Mission-Specific Simulation

**Conditional Phase:**

- Included for Standard and Extended sessions
- Skipped for Quick sessions and review missions
- Adapts to player confidence and mission complexity

**Simulation Features:**

- Complete mission scenario practice
- Multiple conversation threads possible
- Handler coaching accessible
- Emergency protocols available
- Performance tracking active

**Template Structure:**

```markdown
Setting: [Mission Environment Description]
Objective: [Specific Intelligence Goals]
AI Characters: [Personality Profiles and Interaction Styles]
Success Metrics: [Conversation Quality, Information Gathered, Cover Maintained]
Handler Support: [Available Coaching Options and Limitations]
```

## Phase 4: Live Mission (5-20 minutes)

### Social Dynamics Integration

#### Relationship Management Layer

**Three-Target Framework Application:**

- Street Contact: Informal, authenticity-testing interactions
- Professional Contact: Formal, competence-demonstrating interactions  
- Personal Contact: Intimate, vulnerability-requiring interactions

**Template Structure:**

```markdown
Target Profile:
- Name and Role: [Character Identity]
- Relationship Type: [Street/Professional/Personal]
- Vocabulary Domain: [Required Language Skills]
- Pressure Points: [Communication Challenges]
- Handler Coaching Style: [Sheldon/Pane Approach Recommendation]
```

#### Communication Pressure Points

**Standard Challenge Types:**

- Guilt Manipulation: Emotional pressure requiring boundary setting
- Defensive Reactions: Hostility requiring de-escalation skills
- Boundary Testing: Inappropriate requests requiring diplomatic refusal
- Information Fishing: Probing questions requiring deflection techniques

**Template Response Framework:**

```markdown
Pressure Scenario: [Specific Challenge Description]
Instinctive Responses: [Common Player Reactions]
Pane's Coaching: [Direct/Professional Approach]
Sheldon's Coaching: [Empathetic/Relationship-Building Approach]
Mechanical Consequence: [Relationship Meter Effects]
```

### Dialogue Framework Implementation

#### Conversation Flow Management

**Controlled Open-Ended Structure:**

- Mission objectives guide conversation boundaries
- Cover integrity system provides natural constraints

**Graduated Assistance:**

1. Context clues and visual aids (no cover cost)
2. Handler coaching via earpiece (minor cover cost)
3. Translation assistance (moderate cover cost)
4. Emergency intervention (major cover cost)

### Spaced Repetition Integration

#### Natural Vocabulary Review

**Contextual Reinforcement:**

- Previous mission vocabulary resurfaces in conversation
- Cross-domain integration required for advanced missions
