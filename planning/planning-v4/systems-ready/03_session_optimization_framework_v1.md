# Session Time Optimization Framework v1

## Core Philosophy: Respect Player Time Investment

Dark Mallard optimizes for players who can engage meaningfully in 10-20 minute sessions while supporting longer play sessions. Every time investment should provide genuine story progression and language learning value, regardless of session length.

## Session Length Categories

### 10-Minute Quick Sessions

**Target Player:** Daily commuters, lunch break players, busy schedules
**Core Value:** Maintain momentum without story pressure

#### Handler Training Chamber Focus

**Primary Activities:**

- Vocabulary drilling from previous missions (3-4 minutes)
- Agent assistance calls (spaced repetition) (2-3 minutes)
- Quick simulation scenarios (3-4 minutes)
- Mission briefing for next live session (1 minute)

**Example 10-Minute Session:**

1. **Agent Support Call (3 minutes):** "Control, I'm at the airport and need help with customs questions" - player guides them using vocabulary from Mission 1
2. **Vocabulary Drilling (4 minutes):** Review café vocabulary through rapid-fire contextual practice
3. **Mission Preview (2 minutes):** Brief setup for upcoming gallery infiltration mission
4. **Progress Confirmation (1 minute):** Handler acknowledges improvement, sets next session

**Story Integration:**

- No major story beats, but relationships maintained
- Agent assistance provides narrative context for vocabulary review
- Mission previews build anticipation
- Handler relationship continues developing

### 20-Minute Standard Sessions

**Target Player:** Regular engagement, primary session type
**Core Value:** Complete mission cycle with full story progression

#### Full Mission Experience
