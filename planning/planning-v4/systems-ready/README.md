### Implementation Framework

- `01_design_philosophy_v7.md` - Core principles and design approach
- `02_language_learning_methodology_v2.md` - Audio-first learning approach  
- `03_session_optimization_framework_v1.md` - 10-20 minute session design

- `13_cross_system_integration_examples_v1.md` - All systems working together

## Major Changes in This Version

### New Foundation: Conversation System

The entire framework now centers on the conversation mechanics in `00_conversation_system_spec_v2.md`, which establishes:

- **Central Narrative Question**: "To maintain your cover, how much of yourself must you compromise?"
- **Moral Choice Engine**: Language failure forces increasingly difficult decisions
- **Blackmail/Romance Mechanics**: Different approaches with different costs
- **Intel Confidence System**: Uncertain information creates strategic risk
- **Escalating Stakes**: Mission failure ranges from setbacks to literal death

### Archived Components

Previous versions moved to `archive/v3-mission-examples/`:

- Old narrative exploration documents (v2 and v3)
- Mission examples based on previous approach
- Complete v3 framework overview (superseded by conversation system)

## Implementation Sequence

1. **Read the conversation system** (`00_conversation_system_spec_v2.md`) to understand the moral/mechanical foundation
2. **Review core frameworks** (01-09) for implementation details
3. **Study integration examples** (10-13) to see how systems work together
4. **Develop story structure** around the conversation system's moral choices

## Key Success Criteria Validated

✅ **Natural Pacing**: Conversation pressure creates authentic urgency without arbitrary timers  
✅ **Meaningful Sessions**: 10-20 minute moral dilemmas with lasting consequences  
✅ **Clear Integration**: Language learning drives story choices, not separate from them  
✅ **Focused Methodology**: Audio-first approach serves spy thriller context  
✅ **Working Examples**: Conversation system provides concrete implementation model  
✅ **Versatile Framework**: Adapts to different mission types and relationship approaches  
✅ **Natural Spaced Repetition**: Review emerges from story necessity, not artificial drills

The framework is now ready for story development around the established conversation mechanics.

## Overview

This directory contains the complete technical framework for Dark Mallard, a spy thriller language learning game where players learn French by solving mysteries in Paris. The framework proves that sophisticated language learning can be seamlessly integrated with engaging narrative gameplay.
