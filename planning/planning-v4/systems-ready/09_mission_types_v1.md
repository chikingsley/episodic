## Mission Type Selection

Recommended Core 6:

1. Surveillance (listening foundation)
2. Identity Verification (deduction + conversation)
3. Direct Infiltration (speaking under pressure)
4. Agent Training (spaced repetition system)
5. Interrogation (high-stakes dialogue)
6. Detention Track (failure recovery system)

Why these 6:

- Cover all core language skills (listening, speaking, reading context)
- Include both success and failure paths
- Provide variety without overwhelming scope
- Support the core Cover Integrity → Consequence → Learning loop
- Each type uses the dialogue system differently

## Notes on Mission vs Scenario

Mission Type = The KIND of task (surveillance, extraction, etc.)
Mission Scenario = The SETTING where it happens (hotel, café, airport, etc.)

One mission type can happen in multiple scenarios:

- Surveillance can happen at: cafés, parties, streets, hotels
- Infiltration can happen at: hotels, businesses, social events, airports
- Interrogation can happen at: police stations, basements, offices, detention centers

This separation allows for:

- Replayability (same type, different setting)
- Scalable content creation
- Clear mechanical focus per type
- Narrative variety within established systems
