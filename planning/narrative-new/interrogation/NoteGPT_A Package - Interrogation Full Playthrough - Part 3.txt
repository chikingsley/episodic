          hey folks welcome back to what after-work gaming we are back for more interrogation now last time we finished off by reading through these various reports and documents except that we checked out here we did not this is like our little conspiracy redline corkboard about all our cases look at that mr. Peterson was found dead in her house and then Daryl was the murderer and that's how we found out about liberation front then we found that there's chat room and Fred NS or eNOS confessed that he collaborated and he gave us the password
          
          so Liberation Front was known to communicate using Internet chat rooms the online presence of the Liberation Front points towards a substantial number of sympathizers and in his chat rooms are the only communication method identified up until now but many more might be in use the Liberation Front is a young movement organization whose anti-authority rhetoric is gaining increasingly more traction it is centered on the city but spreading through the whole count of country and the Liberation Front believes the
          
          world's current power structures are oppressive and need to be taken down by force a back to my office and let's move on Jennifer so hey boss wanted to clear the water about some stuff that I don't know whether you're even aware of or not I wasn't aware that clear the water is a phrase chief Lucas was looking at the two of us to see who should head up this task force I guess you acing the Peterson grill made it a done deal and I can't say I blame the chief for that call [ __ ] rumors fly really easily so just wanted
          
          to reassure you that I'm fully on board right behind you after all the best leaders are also the best followers watch yourself I had an idea told the chief give it to you nope that's just pandering thanks for the reassurance step up your game I'm a backhanded thing I'm glad to hear it let's do bets do good work whoever's and managing this BAM 10-4 boss ten-four don't let the door hit you on the way out my door is always open good to know mm-hmm I'll be at my desk [Music] hi Jennifer I've been at it for a while
          
          now and I've managed to figure out what most key words mean tain't the algorithm managed to confirm some of these deductions there are some conflicts though either because of cognitive biases or of algorithm errors the your cognitive biases what you're saying Jennifer it's hard to figure out specifics but we have some broad findings the folks in the chat room are just a wing of the whole operation though and I think I've stumbled onto something big the south bank malls something today the planting of a package Jennifer you
          
          know clear the water you don't know what a package means in the context of a terrorist group anyway in front of the Duathlon store apparently they'll have someone there I'm not sure what they're supposed to do though tap we should have the police canvassed ASAP let's move [Music] we have three suspects in custody one of them can potentially be our perp Jennifer the only three we noticed to linger near the Duathlon store one guy that is before the three of them got tangled up in an incident and we had to
          
          intervene yep this is a detailed in the file I drafted up on the way here at Jennifer one of them is the one working on the liberation fronts orders has to be I've checked the chat room again I now think they're dealing with a planted bomb sweet baby Jesus we're on the clock boss that lives are at stake we need to the explosive devices location all right thanks everybody a incident narrative the only three people present the location specified by the secret chat room conversations were brought in for immediate questioning as
          
          our officers were arriving at the scene two of the individuals found at the scene were involved in a conflict Daniel Wilson a security guard working within the commercial complex forcefully apprehended Becky Madonna and exposed that the latter individual carried a concealed firearm the third individual Samantha Lowe was seen talking to Daniel Wilson by our agents as they were arriving at the scene just prior to the subsequent conflict between Wilson and Madonna the chat room conversation revealed that at least one of these
          
          individuals was due to signal the successful planting of a time bomb at a nearby location by being present in seen on the walkway experts estimate that the location of the bomb must be extracted within minutes if the bomb squad wants to disable the device in time hey Daniel Wilson Daniel Wilson is a retired Marine he takes care of his ailing mother and struggles to keep up with the escalating medical bills uh-huh he was operating as a security guard at the location of the incident and is one of the three people
          
          at the scene who could have planted the bomb he is the person who apprehended Becky Madonna as he was attempting to leave the premises Wilson appears to be a close friend of Samantha Lowe who he was entertaining before getting involved in the incident with Madonna Wilson frequently visits Christian work server websites is an active supporter of gun rights and firmly opposed to political correctness suspect by OSA methyl Oh Samantha Lowe is an interior decorator and animal rights activist engaged to be Wed in a month isp
          
          enforced tracking shows that her IP has accessed live raishin front content pertaining to claims of oppression of man and beast she was engaged in conservation with Daniel WA in conversation with Daniel Wilson at the time of the incident and was one of the only three people at the scene she was in she has increased premiums on her bank debts with the bank threatening to cash the mortgage cash the mortgage on the flat she shares with her fiance Akhil Madonna Mikael Madonna arrived in the country on a student visa
          
          seven years ago he enrolled to study material engineering but has no record of attendance after his third year at the University as the phases expiration date he seems to have remained in the country legally likely working on the black market there are very few official records of his activity since he has been sending regular payments to bank accounts in his home country he was one of three people at the specific site or specified site with in developing situations is by being summoned to not leave the premises he attempted to flee
          
          he was stopped and held by Daniel Wilson okay bring him in so here's my thought he looks pretty good to me because he is an inside job right he has access to pretty much the entire mall since he's a security guard and he has an ailing mother so money motive all that stuff will set aside the whole Christian conservative thing and gun rights and whatever that's just in line with what's-his-face that killed his wife because he espoused some of these like really you know I my freedoms and he did this and he did
          
          that's and the immigrants are ruining everything so if that's what the theme for this game this is gonna be this guy but he'll you're the red herring cuz you got the gun and you're just a minor criminal because you're here illegally and you are just random I mean you have some connection here but I don't think you actually did anything and oppression a mana B sounds pretty much in line with the pet care for okay so let's talk here but you've run away the security guard yeah let's start with him and then we'll come back here maybe
          
          because I had an illegal gun for my protection tucked away on me uh-huh what were you doing at the mall shopping as people do and the gun I got it for defense I have to live in a very dangerous neighborhood we'll just confiscate them not charge you but you need to help us see how let's open it up right we're sort of on the clock here sort of we are on the clock here thank you boom listen want to fill in your file a little like what we live in a city in the slums yeah where it's cheap got any family not in the country back

          know nobody cares do you know the woman no have you heard of the Liberation Front no of course not I only heard of them from the news they think about him they are what happens when a cultures dreams become a nightmare really what would you say the liberation Sun stands for or the disillusion fools that think violence might be salvation it's not actually stand for equality they stand for state the solution the solution of authorities and that a noble ideal [Music] but for koalas let's see let's just push
          
          it right then for Claudia ideal perhaps but many ideals may be overturned so you want to just ask the question he's pretty open where's the bomb I sincerely know not what you mean that's a really strange phrase all right fine Danny Danny Danny let's talk about that guy if you can locked up that [ __ ] yeah begin with what did you notice about him being suspicious there's being shifty just that look in his eye don't you ever act on instinct you kiddin I think I read these papers I follow my cuts all the time and since they're

          information it's related to a criminal group active in the city someone planted a bomb and we need to find it do I have your attention now let's go with classified right let's do a little intrigue here mostly because he's a former soldier and he might be into that nonsense ah so you guys are spec ops C and understood ask away I don't know why you think we're spec ops but okay about the Liberation Front [Music] nope closed down a little yeah read something about him what do you know about him not a bunch of murderous psychos and
          
          everybody who works for them says that what would you say they stand for stand for there's just a Chanukah they stand for nothing they actually stand for personal freedom an absolute form of it isn't that I didn't yeah this guy seems like quality state dissolution dissolution of authority well he doesn't look he's like you don't follow the rules right it's one of these two one of these two movies to do these two isn't it a noble ideal yeah what do you think about overthrowing the government that you fought before huh

          big boom took place on the 13th floor a large quantity of explosive material would have been required that floor was closed unpopulated it was set to be refurbished in the coming months we're going to head out again canvass for witnesses Ethan can't find any surveillance hey chief things are not looking good we're receiving actual complaints from the general public about your leadership mildly wet get your act together spurred on by the front who knows what these people might end up doing that is all
          
          excuse me we had two bombs go off that nobody knew about not my problem popularity how much the residents trust your department well I mean we didn't have to bombs explode press approval how friendly the journalists are who write about your investigations and then the authorities how reasonable the institution of the city are and so success all around we managed to find enough for a residue to determine some of the bombs exact components and features we are haven't reached out to her but we've got a lead
          
          on a girl whose boyfriend might be involved with the Liberation Front we can try to convince her to talk to us and by the book the chief called in to say that they appreciate the balance books we keep okay let's start with the newspaper The Herald freedom fighter is exclusive interview with former LF member also by the prescription Becca whoa Patricia continuing our series on the so-called Liberation Front we've done our best to track down anyone that might be able to give a first-hand account of what dealing with the
          
          Liberation Front is like you can beat people but you can't beat the ideas out of their heads that's why the Liberation Front will never be beaten that's that gloomy conclusion of the young twentysomething Liberator after our brief interview eric is a former sleeper agent an agent that has placed his loyalty to the cause and his supporter but has not yet received an order to carry out an operation these agents are usually tasked with reconnaissance of potential targets scouting bomb spots and vetting new recruits he joined
          
          shortly after the terrorist groups first manifest are released although he says that we were part of the same group long before that the oppressed ones despite the increasing internet international attention and the concentrated efforts of authorities little he has yet known about the seemingly expanding terror group who is funding them how large is their member pool what are their objectives why is our city at the center of their attacks speaking through text messages and asking well that his real
          
          name be concealed eric says that few members know this nor do they care to know there isn't a clear hierarchy it's more obfuscated than that I think deliberately to make you feel part of the organization organic movement you don't have some leader you have to salute or bow down before and no one gave me orders and that felt good you know makes you really open own up to what you do like your fire or the fire of the whole very eloquent in his responses and with a surprising analytical view of looking
          
          at his situation Eric does not give the impression of a fanatical warrior but more rather a student activist arguing his case his weaponized sense of ownership of empowerment is not a new thing having been used by terror groups in the past as it is especially effective with the young but Eric says the Liberation Front was a different more persuasive spin on it using the Internet to bring its manifesto right into the potential members homes their propaganda taps into the thing you already believe in books itself into
          
          your feelings about injustice inequality discrimination threats to values and then slowly pulls you to action it's not that your life is bet it's not that your life is bad and you should do something to change it it's bigger than that the world is in bad shape and you need to take action needless to say needless to say violent action is the LF preferred course of action now say violent action or course of action Trisha that great sentence eric says he is no longer part of the liberation front to the
          
          ideological differences but he says he still resonates with them strongly once you cut through the petty words you see that they are just influencing youto as their own ends at the end of the day they are not wrong are they look at the rich look at the powerful then look at you and me and our paycheck look at some poor single mother struggling to put food on the table while a rich idiot stuffs his face on some polluting boat on the money he inherited really makes you want to do something about it
          
          ideology in the classic sense does not seem to be the unifying factor of the front however Eric cans how he was put in touch with another member for potential scouting mission he quickly discovered that he was polar opposites ways of looking at the world not to beat around the bush the girl was a racist plain and simple that's detoured carrying type but still with the income inequality gap between the average workers and the richest growing then situations such as recently uncovered linked to tax evasion
          
          operations spending multiple countries it is doubtless the Liberation Front will find fertile ground for future unrest on the most radical left the radical right is also clearly looking for torch bearers ready to go the extra mile and fundamentalist of all creeds want the new start for society around the world the question remain what does the Liberation Front plan to seed Rebecca is the editor-in-chief of the heraldic she has been working as a journalist for the past 12 years receiving numerous awards
          
          both her editorial investigative work okay well we read this this wasn't great I mean this right here there's an HR report motivation level high tab is moderate variable motivation confidence levels they may fatigue or lack ownership and that team's endeavors well she did fill out paperwork this last time so hey do we have anything new no here we go at the age of eighteen he was involved in an armed robbery attempted attempt target in a local corner store the robbery was stopped by the intervention
