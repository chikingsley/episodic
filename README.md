# Episodic - Language Learning Project

**A narrative-driven language learning platform featuring Dark Mallard**

## Project Structure

This repository contains the planning, prototypes, and development materials for the Episodic language learning application.

### Key Directories

- **`planning/`** - All planning documentation, research, and design materials
  - `planning-v0/` - Initial concepts and early prototypes
  - `planning-v1/` - First iteration planning docs
  - `planning-v2/` - Second iteration with refined concepts
  - `planning-v3/` - Third iteration with narrative focus
  - `planning-v4/` - Current active planning and prototypes

### Current Active Development

**Main Prototype:** `planning/planning-v4/prototypes/mockv4-expoapp/`

This contains the archived Expo React Native app that serves as the foundation for v0 development. The app includes:

- Complete Expo Router setup
- Convex backend integration
- Dark Mallard character system
- Component library and UI system
- Content management structure

### Other Prototypes

- **`chef-prototype-convex-app/`** - Convex backend exploration
- **`duolingo-clone/`** - Reference implementation analysis

## Getting Started

To work with the current app prototype:

```bash
cd planning/planning-v4/prototypes/mockv4-expoapp/
bun install
bun run start
```

## Development Philosophy

This project focuses on creating a language learning experience that:

- Combines narrative storytelling with practical language learning
- Features an engaging character (Dark Mallard) as a learning companion
- Uses spaced repetition and proven learning techniques
- Provides a beautiful, accessible user experience

## Next Steps

See the archived prototype's documentation for detailed next steps:

- `planning/planning-v4/prototypes/mockv4-expoapp/NEXT_STEPS_CHECKLIST.md`
- `planning/planning-v4/prototypes/mockv4-expoapp/V0_PREPARATION.md`

## Project Status

**Current Phase:** v0 Preparation  
**Active Prototype:** mockv4-expoapp  
**Next Milestone:** Working v0 with core learning mechanics
