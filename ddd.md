good analysis - lets skip to the long term goal now. lets create the unified script. call it whisper_grand_mlx - And I want to be specific. what I'm looking for is the best of all the worlds I want it combined not separated I want the best thing so we have the superior performance, but we also have quantization. because in general i'm expecting the 3.5 model to be the best overall. so it woudl be sick if we could get both versions working and then test on longer audio. but yeh - how can we make sure that we get the best of both worlds? is this something we can have pytests or tests for ? or is it something where we should just load it and try and keep iterating? or is it trivial since it's really just combining two things that already work into one? @mlx_whisper @lightning_whisper_mlx
